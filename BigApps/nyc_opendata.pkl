You can link them together into problem sequences, which could be more or less fun, more or less academic. Treasure hunts online.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe web hardly ever demands anything of you. It should ask you more questions. This is good for encouraging cognition and learning, and it can be fun. Think of the goofy surveys they put in glossy magazines. I want to make learning online as much fun as sharing kitten pictures online.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#039;d like to brainstorm a bit more about how this could work, collaborate with some devs on backend implementation, and certainly collaborate with designers to make it look decent (logo, frontend).'

S'MESA is an emergency planning application that determines the best routes of evacuation for input populations in the City, subject to temporal and geo-spatial variables, availability of routes, and the evacuation decisions of others. While a beta version of the application is available to emergency planners, routing information is ultimately most-effective in the hands of those that need it most; hence, the mobile application.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitial studies suggest that in its busiest hour, an un-directed full emergency evacuation of Manhattan would take upwards of a week. These same studies also suggest that using the tools of Operations Research and Computer Science, this figure can be more than halved. Thus, with advancements in social networks and the capture and molding of Big City Data, efficient evacuation routing can not only save time, but potentially lives as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe project needs to be transitioned to a mobile application, and needs the following: mobile application development, front-end design/user interface, the retrieving of information from a database, data-mining &amp; econometrics, and of course, computational efficiency.'

S'The Problem:<br/>\n&quot;In NYC, we throw away more than 6.5 million pounds of food every day. This could fill up 24 subway cars. Or, it could be put to better use as fertilizer and clean energy.&quot; <a href="http://nycbigapps.com/static/food-scraps-brief">http://nycbigapps.com/static/food-scraps-brief</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Solution:<br/>\nWe can radically reduce this number by giving restaurants &amp; other food waste generators a way to measure their food waste &amp; save money. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#039;t solve a problem without measuring it. Mintscraps provides restaurants a simple online platform to measure &amp; track the food waste they generate &amp; calculate how much money they could save by diverting it to food banks and other food waste haulers.<br/>\n<br/>\nEconomic Viability:<br/>\nWith the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s recently announced Food Waste Challenge, there are clear signs that the city faces a problem with the amount of waste it generates and the need for an easy and scalable solution that showcases the business and environmental decisions to appropriately recycle food waste. Mintscraps comes at an opportune time to meet these needs and make a huge impact in NYC.<br/>\nFood Waste Challenge: <a href="http://on.nyc.gov/ZKxjYe">http://on.nyc.gov/ZKxjYe</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe are currently working with a large NYC restaurant chain&#039;s waste stream data to find cost savings and show case in our platform. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we have had discussions with another restaurant chain in NYC who have expressed interest in the app &amp; given us valuable feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nFuture Plans:<br/>\nInitially, data entry will be simple via the app but we aspire to develop an automated system using sensor technology &amp; color coded bags that will be included in a startup kit for restaurants<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Benefits:<br/>\nBy creating a simple tracking tool &amp; offering restaurants better options for disposing of their food waste:<br/>\n- We can save restaurants money by reducing their waste disposal fees &amp; food purchasing costs<br/>\n- Help restaurants streamline operations<br/>\n- And help them benefit from a tax deduction. <br/>\nFinally, we also reduce the amount of waste going into landfills, help the environment, &amp; feed the needy.'

The app would passively record traffic noise. It would be calibrated with an acceptable decibel level as normal. Any spike (ie, a horn or a siren, etc) would get captured to the cloud along with the location, timestamp, and other meta data. It would also count the sounds in a backend database. It\xe2\x80\x99s basically a sound activate recorder, but it would require some calibration and would actually record the audio files in a more useful way.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; A website and back-end to classify captured noise:<br/>\nThe above app will be importing many isolated sound files of noises (honking, ambulance sirens, etc) and the classification will be done automatically or through crowdsourcing/outsourcing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Public API of NYC Noise:<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above will feed into a publicly accessible API that could be queried by:<br/>\n<br/>\nGPS/location + radius<br/>\nType of noise<br/>\nDate/Time<br/>\nAggregate by cohort (hour, day of week, type of noise, location, etc)<br/>\nThe API would also deliver the actual recordings so users could quickly create sound maps as well to hear what an intersection sounds like, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis API would represent the first data-set that measures NYC noise.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Imagine the applications of a Noise API:<br/>\n<br/>\nI\xe2\x80\x99d create a simple \xe2\x80\x9cnoise map\xe2\x80\x9d website using the noise API that would allow users to explore NYC through noise. This would merely represent a use-case of the API. There are many, many other uses of the data that I can imagine, and I know the ingenuity and innovation of NYC techies will find even more interesting ways to utilize the data.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey say you can\xe2\x80\x99t manage what you can\xe2\x80\x99t measure.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier this year, New York City decided to remove all the \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Honk\xe2\x80\x9d signs. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/nyregion/new-york-removes-no-honking-signs.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/nyregion/new-york-removes-no-honking-signs.html?_r=0</a>) A paragraph jumped out at me:<br/>\n<br/>\n// But interviews with officials, residents and cabbies suggest that it is virtually impossible to tell whether honking has decreased in New York City, or to gauge how effective the signs have been. Many said they believed honking had been curbed somewhat, but wondered if they had simply stopped noticing it, allowing the horn to become the ambient soundtrack of their days.//<br/>\n<br/>\nI call BS on that. It is not impossible, it just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been tried yet. I hate honking with a passion and right now what\xe2\x80\x99s needed is a general way to measure traffic noise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to NYC Big Apps, one of the options is to produce a new data set that the city can use.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for an iOS developer who is familiar with the recording capabilities of an iphone. I am also looking for a web developer who is familiar with building an API backend and would have a sense of data architecture for something like this.'

S'Unhealthy food decisions are typically made due to lack of money, time, or knowledge as to what is near. Many people may pick fast food options that are not healthy, which over time, presents health issues the city later will need to handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe want to solve this issue by creating a product to help people find affordable and healthy food nearby. Within the NYC BigApps contest, we&#039;ve created a healthy food venue database (groceries, farmers markets, etc.), as well as the location-aware web application &quot;Healthy Food Compass&quot;, which both serves personal information to the user and operates as data collector tool (crowd-sourcing).<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent Prototype: <a href="http://www.healthyfoodcompass.com">http://www.healthyfoodcompass.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOur application receives the user&#039;s geolocation, and gives food venue options to the user. Once the end user decides, they are able to find out more information (accessibility, EBT acceptance, etc.). The user is able to see location popularity, as well as average reported prices of typical foodstuffs (apple, bananas, etc.) so consumers are able to gut-check the average cost of the products. This is a mobile web app, and is built so that additional featuresets may be added later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional featuresets could include: accessibility in particular healthy food venues; a responsive mobile/desktop web app; multiple language capabilities; generated content to incentivize excitement of healthy foods, or our data trends found within the app; integration with Instagram to show user-generated pictures; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not simply aggregating data - we are also generating data. Crowd-sourced data regarding real-life price points will be integrated with an API, taking the SNAP database and NYC farmers&#039; market/greenmarket databases for geolocation targets, and crossing it with contextual information from Foursquare for each geolocation target (opening hours, popularity, etc.). We can also provide feedback to improve food venue databases.'

S'App that people can speak into to describe an event, a shop that you like, something that happened on the bus, someone is stealing a car and you whisper it into the app, basically whatever you want (do not swear, please!) and all these are tagged to the time, the location and a topic. You get to express yourself only for 10 seconds so you don&#039;t bore anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nA person entering the area could listen to the buzz in the area (if you wanted, you could listen to the stuff people spoke for whatever period). The police could be listening into the feed and could take action as quick as possible. This is good for the blind as well. You could just read the notifications if you do not want to listen to people. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could speak anonymously or as &quot;you&quot;, if you are okay with it. You can have friends and if you only want to listen to what your friends speak, you could! Get overall statistics, topics most spoken about etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople could understand about what people are talking about a certain area: say, the restaurant around the block serves excellent cheesecake, I could speak into it and a person entering the area could listen to the feed or even get a text notification and you could acknowledge it if you really found the restaurant good.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesigning, development'

S'Radius is an app that shows you how you and your friends on facebook are impacted by environmental issues - be it an oil spill, a polluted river, or a climate change event. Radius transforms typically dull and impersonal environmental issues into a social experience, making them relevant to your life, and spurring you to take action in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe asked a simple question: What is the biggest environmental challenge facing society today? You might say climate change, air pollution, or some other challenge. We believe the biggest challenge is something more fundamental than these. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderlying all of these issues is the serious problem of Environmental Apathy - we&#039;ve become indifferent as a society to environmental ills, and as a result there are few big actions taken on any environmental issue. We believe Radius is the way to combat this apathy, spurring interest in cleantech, and generating concern about the environment by connecting the environment to those you care about.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadius was a top ten idea (out of 150 entries from 25 different countries) in the Facebook &quot;Cleantech Goes Social&quot; competition held this February. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking for a developer who sees the potential impact that Radius can have, and ideally someone who has knowledge of mapping systems, particularly in the integration of numerous spatial data sets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPotential Data Sets:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGeographic Environmental Data Sets:<br/>\n<br/>\nEPA API: <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/topicsearch.html#air">http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/topicsearch.html#air</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCoal Plants: <a href="http://en.openei.org/wiki/Coal_Power_Plant_Database">http://en.openei.org/wiki/Coal_Power_Plant_Database</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPV Farm Locations: <a href="https://openpv.nrel.gov/">https://openpv.nrel.gov/</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nWind Farm Locations: <a href="http://archive.awea.org/projects/">http://archive.awea.org/projects/</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nPolluted Waterways: <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-waters/polluters/Connecticut">http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-waters/polluters/Connecticut</a><br/>\n<br/>\nToxic Waste Sites (EPA Superfund Sites): <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-">http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-</a><br/>\nwaters/polluters/Connecticut<br/>\n<br/>\nDrought Areas: <a href="http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/</a>'

S'A tool to quickly locate nearby composting options: receptacles, bins, local gardens, farmers&#039; markets, stores, and other sites that accept food scraps. Data will be displayed based on the requester&#039;s location and include restrictions like date and materials. This app could incorporate a social or competitive element, with frequent composters being rewarded for their participation and able to display their results on various social networks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur reasons are twofold: first, for the casual user who does not want to throw food scraps away. Whether dealing with home or on-the-go food waste, this app will give a quick and simple answer for the &quot;Where do I throw this?&quot; question. Gone are the days of sifting through a dozen websites and showing up at community fairs hoping to hear something useful! Secondly, this app will provide a precious resource for the burgeoning commercial composting sector: knowledge of who is interested in composting and where they are located.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevelopment of the app.'

S'We are making a web based application that allows NGOs to identify what government programs their clients qualify for by uploading a CSV file. Any government agency can upload the program logic and eligibility requirements. These eligibility requirements are matched up against the characteristics of a list of clients to determine their eligibility. This saves the staff of NGOs lots of time, so that they don&#039;t have to compare client characteristics to so many different program eligibility requirements. With that information about program eligibility case managers can make better informed decisions on how to help their clients. This software can complement existing case management software. Our next step is to automatically match that data to program application forms that government agencies currently use. This would reduce the time spent filling out application forms by at least 90%. After starting with organizations that are serving large groups of clients, we would open the platform up to individuals who want to determine what programs they qualify for or be later notified as programs come on board. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am on a New York State council that advises the Governor&#039;s cabinet on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (aka &quot;Obamacare&quot;). From this work I have seen that millions of people qualify for but do not receive government services from programs like Medicaid, Food Stamps, Section 8 and other programs. It is not just programs for the poor, programs like middle income housing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am totally open to new ways to address this problem. I am looking for Web Designers / User Interface &amp; User Experience designers, Web developers (particularly with experience in Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, JavaScript).

S'A platform that helps the students find the perfect internship based on their skills. This platform is going to help students to show their skills and get recommendation from their professors, and specifically get selected for the right internship based on their skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, companies will be able to select the right intern based on its portfolio, work, projects, and also they can use some work for free in their company. As a result, the company its will benefit from a great work for free, and also the student will have his name attached to this work. (So that may help the student move to the next step in his career)<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, on one hand, students are facing big troubles to find the right internship. On the other hand, some companies don&#039;t know the skills of the student applying for the internship and sometimes they chose the wrong one for the wrong place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this solution will improve the way companies hire fresh students, and also help them get focused on their career, and get early into the market.'

By bringing personality matching, economic trends, and job searches to one location in a visually simplistic format, this app will allow anyone to best plan their job search.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite thousands of unemployed workers, many job openings for unfilled due to a lack of knowledge about the role or the skills needed to succeed. From older professionals looking to develop their skills to recent college grads finding their way, millions are looking for direction on their careers. By bringing open data to job seekers in a consumable way, we hope to help the lives of these groups and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, this project is important because we saw many of our friends finding jobs but not careers. We hope this app will help demystify the process of finding work you love and ultimately lead to individuals being happy and more successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nKEY FEATURES<br/>\nUsers can take the Holland Personality Code Test and match it directly with national career data.<br/>\n---<br/>\nUsers can compare multiple careers at the same time looking at tasks, growth, and needed education/preparation.<br/>\n---<br/>\nUsers can manage their job search through the app, by searching in App as well as using a bookmarklet to save individual job listings from specific sites (eg.

Existing ads have been parsed from the Department of Buildings permit dataset to create an existing map of legal ads. Ads that aren&#039;t in the DOB&#039;s list are tagged as possibly illegal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe data that is created by the players of the game is available to the public through an API. It includes a timestamp, geo coordinates, photo, address, and a company name.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew York City has tons of ads, but many of them are illegal. They can be fined up to $25,000, yet it&#039;s hard to go after offenders if the documentation of wrongdoing isn&#039;t captured.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe software can also be repurposed for other datasets that someone might want to track through gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game has been released in the app store for iOS devices.'

S'Biketrains help bicyclists cycle social and cycle safer: meet at different points along a regular route and commute together, enjoying the company of fellow cyclists and the visibility that numbers provide. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are creating a mobile-optimized platform for individuals around NYC to create and join biketrains, much like carpool software for bicycle commuters. The platform will include geocoded biketrains routes individuals can RSVP to or send a message to, a RSVP system that notifies biketrain leaders of participants locations, a mobile-friendly group notification system, a mapped network of bike \xe2\x80\x9cbuddies\xe2\x80\x9d in one\xe2\x80\x99s area, and eventually a real-time feed of bicyclists in a user-specified radius searching for bike buddies to ride with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking to change the way Americans commute to and from work and school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith obesity on the rise, climbing oil prices and signs of global warming, bicycles offer a healthier, environmentally-friendly way of getting around our cities. Some communities are getting the message. Portland, Oregon is home of a primary-school biketrain that replaced the traditional school bus, teaching kids at a very early age the importance of community, safety, health and caring for your environment. A primary-school biketrain in DC recently started as well as well as in our own borough of Brooklyn. And this is just the start of a major paradigm shift to come. New York City needs to lead the way in envisioning a new future for American cities and the way we get around. The platform and tools we are creating will provide safe alternatives for bicycle commuting and will empower individuals by playing an active role in grassroots social change-making. We strive to make it easy for individuals around the city and eventually, around the country, to create their own biketrains, connect individuals, and lower the barrier of entry for commuting by bike. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mission of the biketrain community and platform is to: 1) Increase the number of first-time bicycle commuters 2) Increase frequency of bike commuting 3) Extend the number of fair-weather bicycle commuters who transition to 3- or 4- season cycling 4) Increase safety for all riders with increased visibility of biking 5) Promote bike skills and education: newer riders pick up skills from experienced riders 6) Build community through face-to-face interaction and action and 7) Complement existing bike infrastructure, including bike share programs, advocacy and education organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe need help developing the platform.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are focused now on building the technologies that allow for people to easily create biketrains with geocoded route, search for biketrains in their area, RSVP to a biketrain, contact a biketrain leader or bike buddy to start a train with, and for leaders to be able to notify biketrain participants. The completion of a MVP in this phase will result in a phased private beta testing period, starting first with a small group of NYC companies participating in the Bike to Work Week Challenge mid-May and followed by carefully selected individuals representing a diverse range within our target audiences.'

S'An interactive app that allows NYC residents to record stories of no longer than 3 minutes about significant life events that happened to them in the city and geolocate those on an interactive map. Users can search the map based on key words, listen to stories, and view brief profiles of contributors or become contributors themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#039;m making this app in order to create an emotional, narrative map of New York City. You can think of this app like a Time Capsule, but one with feelings, that offers users a way to experience the city through the real-world stories that take place here each day. City Stories is different from historical walk apps in which a disconnected, present-day narrator describes past events. Here, the city comes alive through the voices of the actual people who lived the experiences. Likewise, these stories celebrate city life through its emotional resonance, rather than solely through fact-based events.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#039;m looking for help with development and design. I know there are audio recording apps that let people use their mobile phone to record and upload narratives to the Web (e.g., Voice Record, Audioboo, Broadcaster). I also know that there are geolocation apps that let people tag themselves to a specific location (e.g., FourSquare). I don&#039;t know how to combine these functionalities into a single proprietary app that also allows people to create profiles and offers searchability. I want to work with a developer/designer team so that funding for this project can be pursued through Kickstarter.'

And thus no way for parents to get notified<br/>\n- No homogeneous review and rating platform for both parents and child care centers <br/>\n- No data for Government/Investors and NGOs to gauge demand<br/>\n<br/>\nHow:<br/>\n- We collate data from various sources and make it accessible via text/mobile/web. Our data contains subsidized, government approved, licensed and permitted child care centers (for NYC) along with centers from around the web.<br/>\n- We provide a platform for child care centers to update their profile and availability information<br/>\n- We offer state of the art reviews and rating system. Our rating system is based on an algorithm that factors 3 types of ratings:<br/>\na. System Rating - Derived from various accredition agencies (E.g.: Violations)<br/>\nb. Social Ratings - Based on reviews by friends and family (Word of mouth)<br/>\nc.

S'I am putting together a team for this year&#039;s International Space Apps Challenge, and I was wondering if you or anyone you know would like to participate? I&#039;m really excited about it, and looking to have some fun. The event is a two day hackathon for a great cause. I&#039;ve started putting together a game plan to tackle the urban poultry farming challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see more about the backyard poultry challenge on the Space Apps website, but here&#039;s some more background: I&#039;ve reached out to a number of poultry farmers (large and small) to understand more about the problem from a first-hand perspective, as well as members of the academic agriculture community to gain a wider understanding of the biological and economic implications and possibilities within urban poultry farming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to tackle this issue because I believe that by changing the way we produce food, we can impact our economy and longevity in tremendously positive ways. Farming used to be a major part of our local economies. I believe that by revitalizing that part of our economy, we can address many health and environmental issues that are plaguing us today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really need are developers and engineers to help me tackle this problem. I grew up on a farm, graduated from Bucknell with a degree in biology, and I&#039;m currently a grad student in biology and statistics, so we have the &quot;farmer/science nerd&quot; role covered. Anyone else who thinks they could contribute to the team is more than welcome to join us. We&#039;re definitely open to anyone who wants to work remotely, too.'

This map is not visible. Instead, the various lines are drawn across a white canvas, forming an evolving, organic matrix of lines over lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the one-month experience, each participant receives via email a numbered limited edition digital print of the final drawing, as co-creators of a collective artwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe project questions the impact of new technologies on our freedom. <br/>\nThe acquiescence of private information is common practice in the app world\xe2\x80\x94when we allow an app to locate us, we disclose our location status in exchange of some kind of instant entertainment. We never give a second thought to the contract we have entered into, by simply accepting passively to be tracked, surrendering our privacy.<br/>\nMARK-IT invites visitors to make the conscious decision to participate in this common practice of acquiescence of private information and in so empowered them again. <br/>\nThe banal exchange of private information, in this case, provides a public service: public art.<br/>\n<br/>\nA basic app is under construction at the moment thanks to some grant money. I would like to add functionalities and think of ways to optimize the participants&#039; experience.'

S'Scaffold is wealth management for people at financial risk. The idea is to give poorer people access to the same good, unbiased (or biased for the listener) advice that wealthy people enjoy. We&#039;ll give 1:1 financial advice on topics like risk mitigation strategies, return on investment, how to invest capital, etc. We&#039;ll improve financial literacy for our clients, and help our advisors understand the problems of less wealthy New Yorkers.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, too many information sources for people in economic distress are either overworked like charity organizations or predatory like payday lenders and check cashers. There is also a large information gap. There are lots of services to help with economic literacy, savings, and financial planning, but no one to tell those at need which services to use for which purpose. We&#039;ll collect, organize and distribute those resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also hope that those helped by the program will later be in a position to help the second wave of users.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could use help with visual design, programming, and copywriting. I would also love to hear from people with experience with helping people out of poverty or with wealth management / personal finance.'

S'We (job seekers) apply for a lot of jobs through various job board sites, for instance, craiglist.org, where we can&#039;t keep track of every listing (job descriptions &amp; requirements) that we applied to. Also, those listings usually get removed or deleted after a certain time. The problem is if we are emailed or called for an interview, often we don&#039;t remember about the job description, job requirements, salary, company information, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where <a href="http://appliedat.com">http://appliedat.com</a> comes in. An organizer web app to help job seekers automatically capture job listings and save right from the web browser using a Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension that you applied for or want to apply to. It helps you to easily trace back to the actual job listing (even if the listing get deleted or expired) anytime, or once you are called for an interview. In addition, it emails and reminds you when to follow-up with a prospective employer (based on your reminder selection). You can also add a list (offline), view your saved listings, and manage follow-up reminders from your iPhone, Android, Blackberry, or Windows Phone using our app or by going to appliedat.com<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile many of us are worried about personalized search results and other ways to help job seekers find jobs, the truth is, most of us also need help with the next step in successfully getting a job. To fill this gap of the next step, we are making this app to help job seekers easily and efficiently manage the jobs they applied to and get prepared for potential job interview questions, get follow up email reminders to follow up with the employer, or to simply see the history of the jobs they applied to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb: <a href="http://appliedat.com">http://appliedat.com</a><br/>\nExtension Download: <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appliedat/idogfbjcbifegomobknfahmkdacbilgg">http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appliedat/idogfbjcbifegomobknfahmkdacbilgg</a><br/>\niOS App: <a href="http://tflig.ht/1baAniQ">http://tflig.ht/1baAniQ</a>'

S'Helping Hands is an ecosystem where people who need hope and people who give help meet. It is a mobile web app that aims to help people navigate, apply and enroll in social benefits. We make help more available, accessible and organized.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording Pew Research Center, many low income people primarily use smartphones to access the internet, because they cannot afford computers. To reach the demographics, we need to create mobile resources to help them apply for assistance. This will keep many more people from falling through the cracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Helping Hands, our design seeks to simplify, and puts human voices in the process. When people are looking for government assistance, so much of that help is unorganized and covered by a smokescreen of difficult wording and confusing processes. This is tough for anyone to read through and understand, and even tougher for the many who are not fluent in English, or have low literacy skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will cover the basic benefits one can enroll in New York City. We help our users organize what to do first and what to do next. By prioritizing the steps in an easy-to-follow manner, we can help take some of the frustration and despair out of the equation, and give much needed hope to others to pull themselves out of a difficult situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly, Helping Hands at its core is a community of helpers, peers and mentors. We provide features that let users give back by sharing their stories, tips and reviews, and words of encouragement to others. Nobody should go through a tough time alone, and our app shows them that they aren&#039;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is our value proposition. Before Helping Hands, people who need help and people who provide help only meet in benefits offices, where long lines and desperate crowds discourage hope. By taking the workload off of social workers, we can reduce their burnout, and increase their productivity. More people can help, and more people can get themselves out of bad situations.'

S'BlinkJobs is a mobile web app in which job openings are automatically curated for users and presented in a series of side by side match ups which ask the user to choose one of the two openings before moving on to the next. This format inspires quick and instinctive decisions. These match ups will display the company, key details, qualifications, and any other useful info. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the user logs in, they choose a job category and are provided with 5 &quot;Blinks&quot; where they compare job opportunities side by side. After the 5 &quot;Blink&quot; series the user is provided with a badge, a results summary, recommendations, encouraging words, and links to helpful resources related to the results. The user can then email these results to themselves and gain useful insight into the best actions to take next.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for a job is daunting and the listings available are scattered on multiple sites. Constantly checking multiple sites, comparing opportunities through various bookmarks is a tedious process that can be demoralizing and overwhelming. This app speeds up the process and encourages users through an interactive approach. <br/>\n<br/>\nBlinkJobs will allow users to compare jobs simply, quickly, and easily. This new innovative approach finds the best job fit for the person and the best person for the job. This app narrows down the seemingly endless mess of options that a job seeker encounters when on the hunt for work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will provide valuable insights to the user about what attracts them to openings/companies as well as increase the number of relevant job openings viewed per time period due to it being a refreshing way to job hunt when compared to the searching and long lists of job titles that the majority of job search sites provide.'

GovSee is Visual... it will let you &quot;Surf the Government&quot; through an intuitive, zoomable user interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Problem<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many times have you read a news article that included a quote from a government official with an obscure title, or from a department you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Office of Special Enforcement? What\xe2\x80\x99s that? The Procurement Policy Board? What do they do? The Deputy Sanitation Commissioner for Long Term Export? Who\xe2\x80\x99s (s)he?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we get below commissioner, secretary, or director level of our better-known agencies, it\xe2\x80\x99s anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess as to how or where these people fit in as pieces of the puzzle that is government. An organization chart might be a good place to start understanding government, but in most cases they are static documents with little information about an agency\xe2\x80\x99s role and even less about the people who are accountable for that agency. Searching for information about the internal organization of government agencies is a daunting task full of disparate org charts, web pages, linkedIn profiles, insider information, FOIA requests, or whatever else can be scraped up. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we evaluate something if we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it works? How can we improve government if we don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what it looks like? Citizens need a useful way to look beyond the politicians in the news to gain a better understanding of the administrations that run the day-to-day of governance.<br/>\n<br/>\nGovSee will put all of this information into one place, and make it easily navigable. You&#039;ll be able to quickly understand who&#039;s who, what they do, and hopefully a lot more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe need frontend and backend developers. Our backend is in rails and our frontend makes heavy use of d3.js.'

S'We are revolutionizing the entertainment industry by finally allowing aspiring actors the ability to apply directly to jobs. We will leverage connecting to their Facebook page to gain real information about them that can help casting directors better find their profile when they have jobs they are a perfect fit for.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Ryan moved to NYC because he loved acting and wanted to pursue a career in it. He loved it so much, he even convinced me to start working as an extra a couple days a week as I wrote my latest book.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, after years of struggling to break into a system that favors connections over talent, Ryan took his own life last September. I want to fix this outdated system of shady talent agents, so that people like Ryan will be able to pursue their dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, part of the proceeds from Casting to the People will go to a nonprofit I started called Ryan&#039;s Fund, which has already started providing new and struggling actors with all the resources (such as professional headshots) they need to succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my goal that not only will every new actor get the shot that they deserve, but also that they will all know and remember my friend Ryan.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have extensively considered and worked out the wireframes for the app, now we just need an MVP so the casting directors can post their jobs and actors can sign up through Facebook and apply to said jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have done some of the design personally, but I would like someone more skilled to do more, I want this app to emphasize good design.'

S'eCruit is entry level and internship job search designed for the actual jobseeker. It takes a jobseeker&#039;s credentials (gpa, major, college) and interests (areas of focus, types of companies, work style, career goals, personality) and creates a map of skills/attributes they are likely to have. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis skill map serves as the starting point for any job search so when you&#039;re looking at companies or opportunities, eCruit shows you the probability of you getting the job, what skills you&#039;re missing to be a top candidate as well as links to resources that will help you gain the skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nCompanies are able to tell eCruit what their &#039;ideal candidate&#039; is and search for students who fit are a fit as far as credentials, interests and their career goals. Once a company has set their talent profile, they can set up a livestream with a group of candidates (a custom google hangout with recruiters, hiring managers, employees and all of the chosen candidates) and add them to the company talent pipeline. Livestreams are saved and added to the company&#039;s profile so other people get the benefits of the chat as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result is a new kind of job search where you:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Know where you stand and how to get the job you want<br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\nb) You get a much better idea of what the job and company are like from actually chatting with people at the company/in the position.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe product is always free for students/jobseekers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a recent grad myself, I know how tough the job market was and how poor the majority of the job search tools were. Super bland, generic job descriptions. Keyword and zipcode searches. Sending your resume to 50 openings and hearing back from 3. <br/>\n<br/>\n48% of college graduates are working in jobs that only require a high school degree (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/underemployed-overeducated_n_2568203.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/underemployed-overeducated_n_2568203.html</a>). At the same time, research from Manpower and other staffing firms indicates that nearly half of all companies state that they&#039;re having trouble filling positions due to &quot;lack of skilled workers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part, student job seekers have access to companies that recruit on their campus. Because of budget limitations, companies select 10-15 campuses to go to and these often overlap on &quot;elite&quot; schools. This leaves other colleges and the talented students there out to dry. Because of this there&#039;s no efficient way to connect talent with opportunity on a national level (No, applying to Requisition 4A-9190820 on Taleo does not count). <br/>\n<br/>\nCompanies with smaller budgets and job openings will never be able to reach that talented, interested recent grad who is working as a barista while hoping to hear back from employers who have thousands of resumes they don&#039;t even look at. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe current system is wasteful and signals a massive market inefficiency. At the entry level, qualified candidates should be able to connect meaningfully with any company who they could potentially be a good fit for. If those companies are able to clearly communicate the skills they require in candidates then we can use the massive array of online education resources (As well as local resources) to train them and make them the perfect candidate!<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I want to try my hand at closing the skills gap and building a new way for people to map out their potential, their future and the lifelong learning that will help them get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Developer:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#039;m a developer but I&#039;d love to have another developer to hack on this with me.

I&#039;m mucked up building views at the moment and I know there are people 1000x better than me at it who could help out.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Marketer or Growth Hacker:<br/>\nI&#039;ve layed the groundwork for a solid online marketing strategy (on/offpage seo optimization, blog seeded with high quality content, active and engaging social media profiles) but I need to find sustainable ways to reach college students (Soph-Sr) at a reasonable cost and with a high conversion rate. This is where a talented marketer could pick up my already executed plan and run with it. We&#039;ve already got students from over 40 schools signed up but we should be at 100 or more!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAn Industrial Psych Major/Psychologist<br/>\nI&#039;ve built out an array of skill maps &amp; tagged a set of resources with certain skills based on feedback from employers.

We help coders find open projects, get code reviews and feedback, and measure their impact as the project progresses. We also help organizations engage with developers and use technology better to achieve their missions. CodeMontage is free to use. Over time, we&#039;re developing an enterprise offering for companies, so this platform will be sustainable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe know from being developers and from teaching beginners that there&#039;s a frustrating gap between learning to code and being able to build robust applications. We also know from hiring and mentoring coders that experience can&#039;t be replaced with canned tutorials. We&#039;re digging right in to real projects to help coders of all levels get the experience they need to get hired and be effective in technology roles.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#039;ve planned features to help coders and organizations track their social impact with technology, so we need help developing them. We also have been moving really quickly and leaving quite a bit of un-optimized code, so someone with performance tuning in mind or dedication to test coverage could make a huge difference by improving our codebase. We&#039;re also always interested in hearing how different people learn technology skills, so just a note of feedback is helpful.'

S'Climafy is an app to help home owners understand the benefits (lower utility bills, higher property value, greater comfort, healthier, lower carbon footprint) of turning their houses into green homes and the tools to quickly and easily find contractors and green lenders to get the energy efficiency upgrades done. It translates the homeowner&#039;s desire for those benefits into action, which means middle- and lower-income families with thousands more dollars in their pocket, a healthier environment (indoor and outdoor), and thousands of new Green Collar jobs for New Yorkers. The app combines a simple user path with social sharing capability.<br/>\n<br/>\n46% of home buyers want green (aka energy efficient) homes, but fewer than 1% of home owners have them. That gap exists because before now it has been too difficult to figure out what to do; now with Climafy, all you need to know is your street address and zipcode. Climafy takes care of the rest.'

S'Feelback is a mobile app intended to connect two kinds of self-awareness that, for many people, don&#039;t work together. The app asks its user to check how they feel now, in relation to the last things they ate. First, the user takes a picture of what they are going to eat or drink. Then they press an emoticon to register a simple feeling, &quot;I&#039;m happy,&quot; &quot;I&#039;m normal,&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m in a bad mood.&quot; The app registers these things and the time of day. An hour later, if the app is in use, it pops up the picture, makes a sweet sound, and prompts &quot;How are you?&quot; with the same three emoticons. Four hours later, it does the same thing. Twenty four hours later, last call.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many times have you lamented, &quot;If I only knew now, what I know now?&quot; People are sometimes powerless to make choices about what they are doing; it just seems to be happening to them. They act out a series of habits they weren&#039;t aware of choosing. Linking body and mood awareness to eating and drinking certifies the user as chief trustee of their own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the project needs a demo presenter for Sunday, May 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the project can use a designer to create four likeable slides of the Feelback process description.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be success!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!'

S'An app that mobile devices can access and that will show both New York City residents and out-of-towners how to stay healthy, happy and out of jail in NYC. The app will, as much as possible, make some critical points about public health, using NYC data and statistics. However, the data is not the point. How the data directly impacts your life and your wallet as a New Yorker is the point. And one more thing: Lifelong Learning in the absence of Healthy Living should be a pretty stunted process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of generic healthy living apps around - I think. I&#039;d like an app that&#039;s about healthy living with a New York attitude, a New York outlook and a New York accent. Ideally, this app will open some sort of window into how we New Yorkers think and give some sort of insight into why we generate 10% of the country&#039;s GDP even though we make up only 5% of the country&#039;s population and why our GDP is almost equal to TX&#039;s - It&#039;s New York immigration, New York attitude (or probably more accurately, New York badassitude)<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything from ideation to implementation.'

The website offers interactive tools for reviewing the standard math, reading, and writing material covered by New York City curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery year, more than 11,000 students who enter the CUNY system require remedial education. They need to re-learn basic skills like math, reading and writing. This number has risen dramatically to nearly 80% of the freshman class over the last few years. Using web-based learning tools, these students can be given the tools to get learn more quickly and get instant feedback on their work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore broadly, there is a shortage of educational tools for teaching reading and writing skills online that are open source. Coursera and Khan Academy have shown us what is possible, but for various reasons none of them offer tools in critical areas such as reading and writing; these gaps can be filled by an open source software project.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need help with design.

This incredibly successful program runs from July 1 to November 15, every year. During this time, the peak season for fresh, local produce, SNAP/EBT recipients can stretch their benefits 40% and expand their food horizons all while supporting local farmers and improving their family\xe2\x80\x99s health.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Health Bucks are going unused!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2011, the redemption rate for Health Bucks distributed through community based organizations was only 71%. That means that 29% of the Health Bucks given out that year were never spent. According to Mayor Bloomberg, these CBOs serve low-income neighborhoods that have high levels of diet related illness such as diabetes and low levels of fresh produce consumption.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe want more New Yorkers to take advantage of this wonderful program so that they and their families can lead healthier lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHBux connects users with clear, convenient info through text message, mobile site, and a free mobile app that invites them to make the most of this opportunity. App Features include:<br/>\n<br/>\nCountdown Clock: Ticks down to the start of the Health Bucks season and motivates users to spend their Health Bucks before the season ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealth Bucks Info: Explains what Health Bucks are, when they\xe2\x80\x99re valid, and where they can be used<br/>\n<br/>\nMarket Locator: Shows local market locations on a map, market hours, and indicates if the market distributes Health Bucks<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Fresh?: Lists produce currently in season<br/>\n<br/>\nNotifications: Provides helpful reminders about important dates and events related to Health Bucks<br/>\n<br/>\nShopping List: Helps users create a list on their smart phone<br/>\n<br/>\nTasty Tips: Offers healthy hints and ideas<br/>\n<br/>\nSharing: Lets users share their enthusiasm for Health Bucks via email<br/>\n<br/>\nFind out how HBux makes it easier for New Yorkers to eat better and live more healthfully at <a href="http://HBux.org">http://HBux.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nProblem Brief: <a href="http://goo.gl/eUftD">http://goo.gl/eUftD</a>'

S'LearnTogether provides online study groups for students who are taking Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Students can use LearnTogether to find great online courses to take. Once you sign up, you are enrolled in a study group that happens once a week. These study groups can be used for mutual help and support with your courses. A game layer is provided on top of these study groups, with students giving each other points for great participation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attrition rate for MOOCs is ridiculously high - only 10% of students who start MOOCs finish them. Lifelong learners get excited to start online courses, but don&#039;t have the support group to finish them. When you take a MOOC alone, it&#039;s easy to sign up for courses, and then never look at them again. We hope that LearnTogether will give students of MOOCs the community they need, and raise the attrition rate even a few percent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#039;d love to make the study group experience really fun. We&#039;re providing gaming elements which incentivize great, continuous participation.

Form private \xe2\x80\x9cgroups\xe2\x80\x9d of people based on personal connections, shared interest, or frequency of sharing information (individuals or multiple friends, family, or colleagues).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Have discussions by adding comments directly to a scrubbed version of the article to draw attention to specific points. This functionality is similar to adding comments when editing a Microsoft Word document. Multiple users in a group are able to leave comments in an article, thus enabling a rich discussion of the article.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. See all of the shared articles and conversations of your groups in central location, the Read With Me dashboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharing and discussing articles sucks. There is a lot to be learned from each other when people read news about current events. Read With Me is about breaking down that wall and allowing engaging discussions to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a difference in the world - we are passionate people who want to change the world for the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a pretty good plan of what we want to create.

S'We&#039;re making a crowd-sourced, have aid/need aid mapping app that greatly increases the efficiencies for relief efforts in disaster relief such as post-Hurricane Sandy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe app allows any aid organization to place a green pin indicating they &quot;have help&quot; available. They are also able to list various resources, etc. that they have. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe app also allows individuals, volunteers, surveyors, responders, etc. to input red pins indicating places where help is needed. Anyone can then respond that they are on their way with specific aid. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis method instantly shows where help is needed and what is needed so that volunteers and aid workers on location can then all work in a more coordinated manner. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first version of the app is now live on iTunes. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease see: <a href="http://mobiledisasterreliefapp.com">http://mobiledisasterreliefapp.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAfter volunteering for Hurricane Sandy Relief, I realized that most of my time was spent trying to figure out where to go and what to do in order to help. <br/>\n<br/>\nI learned that there&#039;s an 80% inefficiency in disaster relief due to &quot;replication&quot; from many different organizations not able to easily communicate with each other. This results in many residents being visited many times while others may not get visited for days. By creating this app, the aid organizations are more effectively able to &quot;divide and conquer&quot; specific locations, as well as communicate and share resources as needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, the app uses a global map so that in making it for Hurricane Sandy, it can actually be used world-wide for any disaster relief in the future.<br/>\n1) Press and writer connections to help spread the word to the general community that this solution is available to help them. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Connections to various city aid organizations and teams so that they are aware that they can use this tool to better coordinate their teams of volunteers, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe app will generate a new data set of people who need aid as well as shelter locations.'

Other entries (such as emergency vets) could be wiki editable and moderated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently bought a new home and realized I didn&#039;t even know what fire district I was in or what the non-emergency numbers were for any of the above mentioned services. This could also prove extremely useful for people who are travelling, visiting family, or just want to have numbers easily at hand<br/>\n<br/>\nObtaining public data about emergency service jurisdictions and importing that into a map.

S'HealthyOut is a smart meal recommender that allows New Yorkers to quickly locate healthy meals at local restaurants. With a few simple clicks, users can search for dishes by nutrition preferences (like calories, nutrition tags like Heart Healthy, Low Fat, Vegetarian) as well as what they&#039;re in the mood for (cuisine, main ingredient, preparation style).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe now spend 50% of our food dollars outside of the home but it&#039;s where we make our least healthy decisions. By using technology to help people proactively make healthy choices, we can start to influence better eating decisions while creating incentives for the restaurant industry to create healthier meals. HealthyOut is now working with restaurants all over the city to display our HealthyOut stickers so customers know where to find a healthy meal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince our launch, HealthyOut has cracked the Top 5 of iTunes Food &amp; Drink and been recommended by doctors, nutritionists, personal trainers and more. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****User Reviews in the App Store****<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;As a physician interested in preventive medicine, I found this app to be extremely helpful to me and the patients I treat.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Love it&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Helps me find healthy restaurants for my diabetic father and dieting brother.

S'Food Cowboy helps food companies and charities route wholesome surplus food to people in need and food waste to composters and alternative energy producers. It includes an online exchange, tracking tools, and food safety, nutrition and quality control features. Our current system is designed to help truckers find food banks when they need to dispose of produce that has been rejected for cosmetic reasons. Today, most of that food gets thrown away because it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to find a dumpster than a food bank. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we want to expand our system by developing an app for rescuing food locally and plan to pilot it in NYC later this year. The app will allow donors and charities to coordinate pick-ups from restaurants and catered events, track food rescue vans, and deliver tax donation paperwork online. It will also give volunteers rewards points and coupons for helping to rescue food.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew York will spend over $100 million this year to feed its 50,000 homeless residents and millions more to feed others who also rely upon soup kitchens for their daily meals. One in four children in New York lives in a home in which food sometimes is not available. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver half the pantries and kitchens in New York reported having to turn away clients, reduce their portion sizes, or limit their hours last year. Meanwhile, at home and in restaurants, we will throw away over a billion pounds of good food this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe estimate Food Cowboy could help reduce the cost of providing emergency food in New York City by two dollars per meal (60%).<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Web app development<br/>\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mobile app development<br/>\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Database design<br/>\n\xe2\x80\xa2 User interface design<br/>\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Social media integration'

S'It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for people to realize the impact of climate change because it\xe2\x80\x99s not something they experience in their everyday lives. Sea level rise is conventionally visualized from above on flood maps, but people live their lives upright \xe2\x80\x94 not from a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view. This project seeks to help remedy that by providing a more human-scaled approach to understanding rising sea levels. Our goal is to raise awareness and encourage discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most recent NOAA data (1) states that in 2100 sea level will be 2 meters higher than current levels. Buildings in Lower Manhattan and other places close to sea level would be partially submerged, or rather: deluged.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are working on:<br/>\n- A mobile/online visualization of a line indicating sea level rise showing building footprints(2), overlaid on building walls and street furniture in street/bird&#039;s eye view, using the Google Maps Android API.<br/>\n- A mobile app that shows, according to how high or low the device is held, the year at which sea level will have risen to that point, using either GPS or gyroscopic sensors.<br/>\n- A mobile app that shows the sea level rise line in Augmented Reality, using for example pictures of buildings as markers.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mobile App development<br/>\n- Quality Assurance<br/>\n- Mapping API specs<br/>\n- 3D GIS visualization<br/>\n<br/>\nWe produced:<br/>\n- KML layer with line at 2m: <a href="http://bit.ly/10crzY6">http://bit.ly/10crzY6</a> (use 3d bldgs in Google Earth)<br/>\n- Prototype Android app with 3D buildings<br/>\n<br/>\nTeam Members:<br/>\nJesse Aboh<br/>\nJason Aboh<br/>\nJonah Bossewitch<br/>\nRumate Razi<br/>\nKlaar De Schepper<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) Parris, A., P.

Originally designed for the NYC Food Waste Challenge, participants will create an account with the city and they will be issued a unique participation code. They will download the app from the App Store, enter their participation code and then start using the app to track the type and volume of their waste stream.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur team has experience in field data collection and waste management. We recognize that our current rate of waste generation is not sustainable, from both an economic and environmental perspective. We&#039;re interested in building tools to help us communicate and collaborate on solving this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are generating our own data set from the participants in the Food Waste Challenge. The data they are entering will include time stamps and volumes associated with each waste stream.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mobile app is pretty much ready, but we could use some help with the website dashboard. It is currently built in Ruby on Rails: <a href="http://www.logcheckapp.com">http://www.logcheckapp.com</a>'

S'We are making an application that solves daily problems while also effecting positive environmental change. Our application, Along the Way, integrates a user&#039;s task calendar with a map to create efficient travel itineraries. The user would use the application to keep track of upcoming tasks (doctor&#039;s appointment, grocery store run, etc.). The application routinely generates efficient routes, including as many stops as possible with minimized travel time, fuel use and pollution creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody has problems they have to solve in their daily lives (When do I pick up a new carton of milk?) People, without thinking, solve these problems (I&#039;ll grab it on the way home from work). We wanted to make an app which would solve the problem of schedule management by suggesting routes which reduce travel time and fuel use and pollution creation. In this way, the problem of individual schedule management is solved while helping to reduce the environmental cost of transportation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWebsite design, development, and implementation.'

S'Canary is a smart smoke detector and air monitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPHYSICAL DEVICE: Can be installed on the wall in place of your regular smoke detector. It monitors fire, carbon monoxide and tracks the air quality of your home.<br/>\n<br/>\nALWAYS CONNECTED: We give you the unique the ability to receive phone calls and SMS if there&#039;s an emergency. It doesn&#039;t just beep at you if the battery is out or if there&#039;s a problem. It&#039;s a sophisticated and simple air quality alert tool that monitors .<br/>\n<br/>\nYOUR SMARTPHONE MANAGES THE DEVICE: Have you ever gotten up in the middle of the night because your smoke detector was screeching? We&#039;re here to solve that. Alerts are sent right to your phone where you are explained the situation. Maybe the battery is low, or maybe it&#039;s an emergency. We let you know through the Canary webapp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSMARTER CITY: Imagine renting an apartment or buying a home and knowing the air quality of the place first. We&#039;ve developed a brand-new data set for New York City to let us do exactly that. It&#039;s available through a RESTful web API that is well-documented and publicly available. With devices all over the city, we&#039;ll be able to start monitoring how air is impacting our daily lives. And with an API, any developer can add to it. But we&#039;ve also gathered open city data to track outdoor air quality. Thanks to data sets from AirNow, DEC, Health, and others for providing the data.<br/>\n<br/>\nBEAUTIFUL DESIGN: Canary looks beautiful on a wall and connects you to the information you need to know. Whether it&#039;s your breathing air quality or alerts about a fire or exposure to carbon monoxide, Canary broadcasts chirps to give you the information you need, exactly when you need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGRANDMA FRIENDLY: The city is a diverse place. This work in English, Russian, Spanish, Afrikaans, and Mandarin, directly from a landline. Just dial 240-669-2679<br/>\n<br/>\nBETTER HEALTH: It&#039;s estimated that 6% of deaths in the city are due to poor air quality. It&#039;s unacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nLEARN MORE: Go to <a href="http://canarydetector.com">http://canarydetector.com</a>'

S'(For NYCBigApps. The plan to work on this at the NYC BigApps CityCamp, Saturday, June 1. For a more thorough exploration, see the link at the bottom.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hanging iFrames: Exhibitions of Data&quot; proposes a new way to present collections of data sets online: Each dataset in a frame, in an interface that replicates the experience of moving through a museum. This visual choice not to be glib: An art museum must present hundreds or thousands of paintings -- with different but related artists, styles, times and places -- in a way for non-liner exploration yet making their relationship clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of an online exhibition for civic datasets, like the physical museum it would be divided into wings of borad categories, with each wing divided into smaller rooms that can number from a few to dozens, and the experience of browsing datasets a horizontally-scrolling experience like scrutinizing paintings on a wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s called data curation and the term \xe2\x80\x9ccuration\xe2\x80\x9d comes from the world of museums: Defined, the organization and maintance of items in a collection. Museum curators know, however, that a key part of their civic mission is presentation of what they have. Developers know that trying to get a handle of what data is available, a task usually done looking at spreadsheets, can frustrate and preclude projects before they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cmuseum of data\xe2\x80\x9d is a metaphor. It\xe2\x80\x99s a interface built on a metaphor, and one that could dramatically improve the usability of data by making it easier to explore civic data, discover what\xe2\x80\x99s there and understand the relationship among sets.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb designers and coders are especially needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nRelevant links:<br/>\nAdobe Museum of Digital Media: <a href="http://www.adobemuseum.com/">http://www.adobemuseum.com/</a><br/>\nMetropolitan Museum of Modern Art Interactive Map: <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/museum-map">http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/museum-map</a><br/>\n<a href="http://nycbigappscitycamp.eventbrite.com/">http://nycbigappscitycamp.eventbrite.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information about the project, with images and links: <a href="http://sandersonmichael.tumblr.com/post/51740357936">http://sandersonmichael.tumblr.com/post/51740357936</a>'

S'Humans are exploring the world at staggering rates. Consider this: in 1960 humans took 25 million trips abroad, in 2012 we collectively took one BILLION trips. Last year NYC alone welcomed a record high of 52 million visitors; a number expected to grow over 5% to 55 million by 2015. And, the scale of global tourism is so massive it contributes to the economy on the same scale as energy, finance and agriculture (~ $6.4 Trillion CY \xe2\x80\x9812).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the value of tourism should not be measured solely in numerical terms, exploration of our surroundings fulfills an innate, and powerful, human desire to \xe2\x80\x9cassign meaning\xe2\x80\x9d to locations, a desire to create new stories and recall powerful memories. Anthropologists have identified this phenomenon \xe2\x80\x9cplacemaking.\xe2\x80\x9d Understanding the significance \xe2\x80\x93historic or otherwise \xe2\x80\x93 of a location is an essential component of placemaking because it provides context for the present. Unfortunately, it is hard for tourists to find compelling, location-based content from a single source on-the-go.<br/>\nEnter BLDG BLOK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLDG BLOK has crafted content and partnered with some of the city\xe2\x80\x99s leading cultural institutions to provide tourists with exclusive access to historical photos and stories about NYC. Whether through self-guided discovery of the rare content or via expertly curated \xe2\x80\x9ctours,\xe2\x80\x9d users will experience the city and placemake in a truly meaningful way with BLDG BLOK.<br/>\nCurrently, BLDG BLOK is a mobile website leveraging the Twitter API for login; soon BLDG BLOK will be available in iOS and Android. Today, the CMS contains content on Herald Square and the Empire State Building, but throughout the summer the CMS will grow to include photos and stories from all five boroughs. BLDG BLOK incorporates a robust data capture system to record content engagement rates and real-world site usage that BLDG BLOK, GoNYC and others could leverage for strategic planning purposes.<br/>\nUltimately, BLDG BLOK helps tourists answer, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?

S'AirCasting is a platform for recording, mapping, and sharing health and environmental data using your smartphone. Each AirCasting session lets you capture real-world measurements, annotate the data to tell your story, and share it via the CrowdMap. AirCasting has fostered a DIY environmental monitoring community which maps thousands of measurements a month from enviro-sense and bio-sense devices and visualizes the measurements using LED clothing and accessories.<br/>\n<br/>\nAirCasting is targeted at community based organizations, schools, research institutions, and citizen scientists interested in health and environmental monitoring, electrical &amp; mechanical engineering, fashion &amp; design, rapid prototyping, and open source code. Participants include citizen scientists from around the world; students at Queens Vocational &amp; Technical High School and the Lyons Community School; scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and Sonoma Technology; researchers at NYU Wagner, Wagner College, and Bank Street College; doctors at NYU Institute of Environmental Medicine; software developers at Lunar Logic Polska; educators at the New York Hall of Science and Parsons the New School for design; members of the Newtown Creek Alliance; and youth from the YMCA, Girl Scouts, and the Jacob Riis Houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first version of the AirCasting Android app and website were launched in December 2011. We began AirCasting by measuring sound levels in New York City for three reasons: 1) new Yorkers care about neighborhood noise - it\xe2\x80\x99s the #1 complaint filed with the City\xe2\x80\x99s 311 hotline; 2) unwanted noise negatively impacts people\xe2\x80\x99s health; and 3) smartphones already have microphones, so no additional hardware was required. Starting with noise monitoring allowed us to build out the basic functionality of the app while addressing an environmental problem of great concern to a large number of New Yorkers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the following months we worked to expand the range of enviro-sense devices that plug into the AirCasting platform to include carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, temperature, and relative humidity sensors and added connectivity for our first bio-sense device, a heart rate monitor. We also programmed the app to interface with custom-designed sensor packages, leaving the door open for the DIY community to add new sensors.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom its inception, the development of the AirCasting platform has been informed by feedback from community based organizations and educators who are actively engaged in running programs that utilize and build on top of our technologies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of what happens in our immediate environment passes without note despite the positive contribution that recording and crowdsourcing these moments might have on our understanding of our health and the health of our communities. AirCasting is a platform for capturing this lost reality and returning it to us as useful, actionable data. By making it possible for AirCasters to annotate specific environmental and biological moments in time and space, we are supplementing the qualitative information reported by conscious human experience with the quantitative information from sensing equipment that observes and records aspects of our bodies and our environments that are either impossible to perceive directly (e.g. pollutant gas concentrations) or difficult to quantify and communicate in a consistent manner (e.g. noise levels). By creating a platform that crowdsources data from thousands or potentially millions of cybernetic devices, AirCasting becomes an analytics engine capable of picking out emergent patterns in human environments and biology.<br/>\n<br/>\nHabitatMap, as the organization that manages the development of the AirCasting platform, has a specific set of goals for the AirCasting project, developed in partnership with the community based organizations and educators we work with on a regular basis. These goals are to: 1) equip youth and community advocates with the skills, knowledge, and tools to record, interpret, and communicate air quality information; 2) furnish youth and community advocates with hands-on learning experiences that encourage them to engage with their environment, participate in community life, and understand why science, technology, engineering, art &amp; design and mathematics are important in the context of solving real world problems; and (3) provide meaningful and accessible air quality information to the public and policy makers that will lead to more informed decision making and improved air quality.'

S'What is the app?<br/>\n<br/>\nEnergyZip allows you to explore electricity usage across the five boroughs and compare your usage against predicted future use, to your neighbors and to the city. We invite you to enter your recent electricity usage and, from this data and the average seasonal modulation for US households, we predict what your electricity consumption will be for the rest of the year and how your use compares with your neighbors&#039;. Currently there is no public data for how electricity use varies from month to month in New York City. With user input we will build such this data set and make it public.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are we making it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeasonal modulation of electricity use is of vital importance. First, New York experiences freezing winters and steaming hot summers - large temperature differences that we mitigate by heating and cooling our homes using electricity. Second, New York City buildings are aging, and their often poor insulation exacerbates the problem of maintaining a stable indoor climate. Finally, the majority of New York City electricity comes from fossil fuels. Together this means the city exacts a heavy price on the environment, a price that can be mitigated by steps such as upgrading windows, painting their roofs white and using more energy efficient A/Cs. Seasonal data for the city will allow us to identify the buildings with unusually large seasonal variation - and they can be targeted for energy efficiency improvements.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is the app improving New York City for residents and visitors?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will educate them on New York City&#039;s energy budget, their carbon footprint, if their house is poorly insulated and could be improved, on renewable energy tax credits and more. With enough data collected by visitors to the site, the understanding we will gain on the seasonal modulation can be used to guide policy and city efforts in reducing the power use in NYC and its carbon footprint.'

You can also find the nearest subway entrance and bus stops to your location as well as any location in New York City.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are making this app because currently, the only way to check your balance and see how many fares left you have is at a turnstile or a fare machine. As New Yorkers there have been too many times where we entered a subway entrance and swiped our MetroCard just to find out we do not have any fares left.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you get to the subway or bus stop, find out you don&#039;t have enough balance and you don&#039;t have enough money on you? With FaresLeft.com you can check your balance before you head out the door and know in advance if you need to refill your MetroCard. You can also visit the website on your mobile smartphone if you are on the go. For parents, you can now be confident your child has enough on their MetroCard to make it to and from school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides being able to check your MetroCard balance, we would also like to provide the ability to refill your MetroCard online through the website, making it even more convenient to use a MetroCard.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaresLeft improves NYC residents and its visitor lives by making something that is inconvenient, convenient. <br/>\n<br/>\nFaresLeft eliminates the frustrations of not having enough balance on your MetroCard as well as not being able to check your balance at fare checker machines. By being able to know your balance ahead of time, New Yorkers will make better use of their MetroCard, thereby increasing mass transit use. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more people using mass transit the less vehicle traffic there will be, reducing congestion and pollution. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe easier it is for for people to use their MetroCard the more they will be willing to use it.

S'Plexx is a mobile application where people can train skills to get a job. The app allows them to explore jobs by industries, browse open jobs around them, train skills, and apply to those jobs to advance their careers. It allows the user to start the process on their mobile phone and continue it at a job center, with the help of professionals at the city agencies and non-profits who offer workforce development support. It allows people who may not have access to a computer, a personal network, or access to information to get through the job hunting process successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n225M young people around the world are un- or underemployed, yet 40% of employers say lack of skills is the main reason for entry-level vacancies. In New York alone, 1 in 5 youth is unemployed. This 20% rate is more than twice the city\xe2\x80\x99s average. According to the 2013 NYCETC Mayoral Agenda for Employment and Training \xe2\x80\x9cNew York City is continuing to face a jobs crisis with the highest sustained unemployment rates experienced in decades - a staggering 9.1% across the City. African-Americans, Latino/as, and younger workers have endured a disproportionately weak recovery. While recent job growth has been concentrated in low-wage industries and exacerbated income inequality, employers are challenged to find candidates with the necessary skills to fill job openings. About 46 percent of all current jobs are classified as middle-skill, which require more than a high school diploma and less than a four year college degree, but only 39 percent of New York workers have the credentials to fill them. \xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has become increasingly challenging for young people without college degrees to jumpstart a career even though many jobs don\xe2\x80\x99t require one. Plexx aspires to create an alternative path to employment. Through our mobile application we will connect learners to open jobs, relevant training content, and available resources to help them prepare and apply for these open jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeaningful employment is the best remedy for poverty. Our application will allow people to connect to jobs, training, and other resources such as job centers, to help them secure meaningful employment. Our vision is to enable people without college degrees to start careers and overcome the cycle of poverty by accessing real time data and resources that can guide them through the employment process. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlexx provides a professional training and life long learning opportunity for New Yorkers and the world. Plexx will also allow organizations that focus on job and economic mobility to connect with users via mobile technology to help them achieve their professional goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lower unemployment rate means greater prosperity for New York residents and city agencies as working class residents can rise to the middle class and can contribute tax revenue to the city. Additionally, agencies that provide workforce development services can serve more people at a lower cost with the help of Plexx&#039;s technology.'

S'Tired of dealing with roommate problems? Ready to clean this mess up for good? Here is a mobile application that makes shared living easier. The primary features of the app are the shared checklist and reputation economy that work hand in hand. As roommates use the reminders to maximize efficiency, reputation capital is built so that future roommate searching is more compatible and easy (Robbie is good at everyday tasks, not so excited about shopping, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nRoommate issues are common among shared living situations. Amongst the many makeshift solutions, many roommates put messages on bulletin boards or magnet reminders on refrigerators. However, because a majority of the time, roommates may not be at home at the same time, lack of communication (or miscommunication) triggers unpleasant relationships. This passive app centralizes everything and makes it mobile so that roommates are always connected.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew York City is densely populated. Many people share living spaces to survive. This app will make life much more pleasant for residents and visitors alike.'

S'The Teen Dating Violence NYC app looks to tackle the big issue of youth and dating violence in New York City. 1 in 10 teenagers in New York City schools (~53,000 teenagers)[1] report experiencing physical or sexual violence in a dating relationship within the past year [2] so this app looks to help solve that problem by giving teens information on dating violence, how to keep safe as well as various places to find help within New York City.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this app, teens can read more about what dating violence is, definitions of each type of abuse, take basic quizzes that give them an interactive way to answer their questions about relationships as well as characteristics of healthy and unhealthy relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther information that is included in this app are sections about keeping safe from abuse, tips for safety-planning, breaking-up, communication as well as tips for helping a friend. To address the fact that most teens are &quot;plugged in&quot; these days, there is also a section on technology so teens can learn basis do&#039;s and dont&#039;s, web safety tips as well as tips about texting, online check-in&#039;s for sites like foursquare as well as social networking tips for sites like Facebook.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, teens can find resources to numerous places in New York City so that they can seek help including a directory of local and national hotlines, outreach centers around the five boroughs as well as support systems around them. Giving teens in New York City this information that is well organized, all in one place and accessible right on their mobile device, they can now know that they are not alone if they are experiencing abuse and that there are numerous resources around them.<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] United States Census estimates 531,501 teenagers, age 15-19 are living in New York City. <a href="http://1.usa.gov/eQewP4">http://1.usa.gov/eQewP4</a><br/>\n[2]\xc2\xa0 New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

S'Assessing the quality of a single dataset is hard enough, and assessing the quality of a thousand datasets is even harder. Data portal maintainers currently have no good way of assessing standards across datasets within a data portal. The AppGen Audit provides metrics and visualizations for New York City&#039;s open data portal maintainers so we can advance the status of open data in the city.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppGen was originally conceived as a rapid prototyping tool that would allow people to browse the superset of open civic datasets in the form of standalone, fully functional and branded web applications. It takes all the datasets from Socrata data portals, analyzes them to find stochastic linkages, merges disparate datasets, applies visual styles, writes product copy and composes visual brand. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the process of building this civic technology rapid-prototyping tool, we discovered that we were in the unique position required to provide essential feedback to data portal maintainers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started by downloading all datasets (over 1,200 datasets) from the New York City open data portal. We cataloging them by various means, allowing us to discover and connect datasets in ways that were not possible before.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, we compiled a set of dataset best practices for the creation and maintainence of open data portals, and we built auditing tools around these best practices. The AppGen Audit is the resulting tool that helps data portal maintainers assess and improve data quality by understanding the connections among the various datasets in the data portal.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#039;m having trouble entering the list of datasets we used into the form, so I&#039;m linking to the list. Here are the 4x4 Socrata identifiers for all 1,238 datasets that we used.<br/>\n<a href="https://github.com/appgen/cache-socrata/tree/master/views">https://github.com/appgen/cache-socrata/tree/master/views</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMake the Socrata URL by prepending &quot;https://data.cityofnewyork.us/-/-/&quot; to the identifier; for example, the URL for dataset 26ze-s5bx is<br/>\n<a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/-/-/26ze-s5bx">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/-/-/26ze-s5bx</a>'

S'The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding for a project entitled Closing the Gap: Turning SIS/LMS Data into Action which surveyed members of the U.S. K-12 education community to understand their attitudes toward SIS solutions.<br/>\n-Only 46 percent of teachers, 35 percent of school leaders, and 47 percent of district leaders reported that they&#039;re satisfied on the whole with the SIS currently deployed at their institutions.<br/>\n-Only 29 percent of teachers said their SIS lets them spend more time on teaching and less time on administrative tasks. <br/>\n-Only 23 percent said data from their SIS helps them prepare classroom activities. <br/>\n-Only 23 percent indicated they think they&#039;re getting the most value possible out of their SIS.<br/>\n<br/>\nUniversity Direct offers basic SIS modules like attendance tracking, grade book management, calendar management, file sharing, reporting, etc, but extends these features with integration of third party API&#039;s, open source software, and web scraping educational content across the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe super admin module is a 100% custom CMS allowing the development team to manage the site as a whole with activities such as adding new schools, conducting surveys, or managing site training videos. Each school if fully customizable at the super admin level allowing us to create default setups whether it be an elementary school or major university.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a school is added to the system they receive access to their own school admin module in which the school can manage users, courses, terms, reports, events, etc at the school level. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach user is given a login from the school. Teachers can create class and assignment events, message students, generate reports and automatic syllabuses, etc. Student have the same type of portal but different rights in managing information.<br/>\n<br/>\nKey components that make University Direct unique from existing SIS platforms is its integration of existing third party API&#039;s and open source platforms.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraveling is one of my true joys in life. &quot;How I wish I had a way to make money while traveling!&quot; I said to myself one day. I came across an article about an iPhone developer who created applications and created a freelancing job for himself. &quot;I could do that!&quot;, I exclaimed aloud to no one in particular. But where to learn such a thing? I had never typed one line of code in my entire life.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the next several months I took to the web. Youtube, stack overflow, technopedia, github, iTunesU, and not to mention hundreds of blogs and tutorials developed by those who came before me. What a wealth of information that exists already on the internet! And as I searched, read, and practiced, I slowly developed a successful freelancing business that still exists to this day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs accessibility to the web and mobile applications continues to increase exponentially, so does the amount of content therein. There already exists such a vast and endless source of educational content yet my sister, an 8th grade Spanish teacher, must write new lesson plans and content to present to her students each day. She works tirelessly from the dinner table even when her official &#039;work day&#039; has ended.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if teachers had more time to\xe2\x80\xa6 teach? What if instead of generating new content, we increase the organization and access to the existing content on the web? What if we leveraged Facebook, Google Docs, DropBox, and the dozens of other applications that are already connecting our world in new ways? What if we tapped into the educational resources of Khan Academy and Scholastic.com? What if we mobilized it and made it available anywhere? What if we developed our own API to allow others to connect their already existing teaching tools and resources into a growing community?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my friends if we did that, then we&#039;d have only begun my dream for the University Direct platform.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to schools.nyc.gov just shy of 1 million students were enrolled for the 2012-2013 school year in New York City alone. A wide spread adoption of a platform such as University Direct would give students accessibility to teaching materials at home, from public libraries, from other states and locations across the globe, and to give them access to focused and consolidated education resources anytime, anywhere. Schools within New York City could pool resources together to submit to the community portal to facilitate resource sharing further reducing cost and time needed for resource origination. By customizing the University Direct platform to meet the educational reporting requirements of New York State, the application could quickly be put to use in the remaining 4700+ New York public school districts, affecting the life long education of over 2.7 million New York State students.<br/>\n<br/>\nEducation propogates into the core of economic stability. What we can do for 2.7 million students now is what we can do for 2.7 million future job holders, contributors to the New York economy and culture.'

S'POPS is an acronym for Privately Owned Public Space. According to the City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Planning, it is \xe2\x80\x9can amenity provided and maintained by a developer for public use, in exchange for additional floor area.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, a developer in a high-density commercial or residential area can build higher than would normally be allowed by zoning regulations if a portion of the building lot is set aside as a public space. Until now, data on POPS has been limited, outdated, or difficult to find, and we saw an opportunity to research and share this information in a new and more useful way. We hope this app will help reactivate under-used spaces across the city; provide users with meaningful information about the history and changing status of POPS; and harness crowdsourcing to share interesting finds and provide meaningful, up-to-date feedback on quality.'

S'This is app was inspired by the times that I&#039;ve been out with friends in a new neighborhood around the city and have literally not known which way to walk to get something to eat. It lets users explore the streets around them by seeing the density of restaurants per city block indicated in shades of orange, healthy (non-greasy) restaurants as red dots, sidewalk cafes as purple dots and grocery stores as green dots.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsers can search for the 10 closest locations by cuisine (Indian, salad, coffee), amenity (sidewalk cafe, bar, grocery, deli) or by business name (Starbucks, Spotted Pig).<br/>\n<br/>\nSearch results are prioritized according to the total number of restaurants on a block. This is intended to minimize the cost of arriving at a restaurant and not liking the menu, ambiance or wait time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe app encourages users to seek out fresh food (non-greasy restaurants), fresh air (sidewalk cafes) and fresh produce (grocery stores). It also encourages them to get those locations by walking or by using the subway system. It can also be used as an aid for house hunting to identify the relative distribution of amenities in a neighborhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe determination of healthy restaurants (red dots) was based on a careful review of city-assigned cuisine designations and extrapolated to the ~30,000 restaurants in the 5 boroughs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis app was built WITHOUT using the API&#039;s or data from any other recommendation website.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis app will search cuisine types and restaurant names, but WILL NOT find individual menu items.'

S'Eatify is currently an iPhone application (and the Android app is in development) that provides a clean search interface for finding restaurants and viewing their inspection grade and sanitation violations. It is backed by a rails app which seeds its database from the NYC restaurant inspection dataset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to provide an easy way for people to access the inspection grades and sanitation violations of restaurants in NYC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in Vermont where I not only had the pleasure of enjoying garden-to-table meals (when deer didn&#039;t get to the vegetables before I did!) but where I also was a part of the gardening process. I believe that it&#039;s valuable to know how the food I eat was grown, in what environment it was grown in, and so on. It&#039;s not possible to receive this information for every restaurant I might eat at in NYC, but a close alternative is to receive information about restaurant&#039;s inspection grades and sanitation violations. &quot;According the Department of Health, tainted restaurant food accounts for more than 10,000 visits to the emergency room and 5,000 hospitalizations each year; providing customers with easy-to-access information may help them avoid joining those totals&quot; (<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/grading-new-york-restaurants-whats-in-an-a/">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/grading-new-york-restaurants-whats-in-an-a/</a>). I&#039;m making this app to edify the city&#039;s knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nEatify is making residents more aware of the current sanitation grades and inspection violations at NYC restaurants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe information exists (in csv files) but as it is, it isn&#039;t easy to leverage. By placing it into a database accessible via a REST api and allowing myself (as well as other developers) to build interfaces off of it, it becomes useful to developers as well as to residents and visitors.'

S'Our concept is live as a website and a mobile application. People can download it. Our goal is to be a mobile application to help users find fitness easily based on GPS or geo-location, rate + review fitness establishments, share fitness experiences socially, check-in via foursquare, find friends using FiTMAPPED, upload pictures of their fitness experiences, and soon engage one another through our social platform. Note: At this time, when users search for a listing and land on a studio page, they have the option to rate + review it, share the studio info socially, share their review socially or check into a location on Foursquare via our app. That is how we are working with the foursquare API at this time. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe feel that urban markets like NYC and LA need a concept that aggregates the fitness establishments in a comprehensive manner and is able to provide results based on a variety of search criteria. This app was created as a result of the expanding boutique industry. Finding fitness establishments for any type of user should not be difficult and because fitness tends to be hyper local, the location should automate to your current area. With additional enhancements to include social features, we hope that the app is more utilized.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur app is positioned as a wellness resource. Insurance providers, healthcare practitioners, wellness professionals, and corporate wellness programs could and should encourage use of the app to help their clients/patients get fit and stay fit in a mobile, local and social way.'

S'A web based app that gathers information from government and non-government entities, to make it easy and fun to enjoy the outdoors, by showing this data in various data presentations. 14 data Sets come from NYC Open Data Directories of Parks and Recreation facilites. The other sources are via Meetup and foursqure API&#039;s<br/>\n<br/>\nThe City of New York has a vast number of resources available to it&#039;s citizens. The app is intended to make it fun and easy to find and use these resources. The emphasis is to show where physical activities or sporting activities can take place. The more active people are, the healthier and fit they are. To help in motivating people to step out, exercise, and have fun, if that were not enough, reward incentives are used.<br/>\n<br/>\nProviding information about resources, and people that are participating in physical activity, be it organized in teams or done independently is a step towards actually doing the activities and meeting people. Participating in activities such as exercise groups, walks, hikes, swimming, horseback riding, etc can only benefit the individual and the community. With the app&#039;s ability to link to feedback mechanisms, NYC government can directly find out how their resources are being used and be in a better position to allocate their resources, physical or financial.'

S'Edviser is the only e-mentoring platform that integrates with the city\xe2\x80\x99s existing unemployment infrastructure. Edviser was born from a series of conversations with these professional unemployment experts who suggested integrated tools to facilitate mentoring for the underserved. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe focus on these five (5) factors: Anonymity, Website-based, Ease of UI, Custody of information, Guided engagement<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for a job is a difficult process and there are some 7.8% of Americans who are unemployed. Yet, locally, everyday, there are committed professionals working on this problem. To provide them with the tools that need--based directly on interviews with them and developed in partnership with these organizations--is the best way to effect realistic, in-the-field change.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether is a new college-graduate seeking work or a single mom who lost her job in the economic downturn, being employed is crucial to one&#039;s sense of identity. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe hope that edviser is able to bring back that support network that our city&#039;s agencies are struggling to maintain given their daunting task. Our understanding is that this tool will help the agencies better decentralize the skills training courses they currently engage in.'

S'This is a special health condition and information notification app. Using NFC tags and NFC technology, it reads relevant and Just-in-Time medical information from the person, wearing the NFC tag, who is in need of help and cannot properly nor appropriately communicate his or her unique medical needs after a significant health event (people with heart conditions, diabetic shock, narcolepsy, fainting [due to wrong medication, dehydration or exhaustion], the elderly, the young children, women with early pregnancy and many others).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis app&#039;s strategy is a preventive measure to help the poor, the very young and the elderly where their understanding of their medical health may not be optimal due to various or limited background in education and culture. The app&#039;s ultimate goal is to provide a standardize protocol in notifying emergency care or medical care providers in providing the Just-in-Time relevant and proper medical information of the person in need of help where the person may be unconscious or rendered incoherent in communication due to a medical/health event. This app&#039;s strategy enhances correctness and efficiency in delivering medical care because the relevant info are visually rendered in a standardize format so the care provider can concentrate on providng the right treatment without wasting time doing ad-hoc tests nor asking potentially complex medical questions from others or the person in need of help where language issues or language barriers may exist especially in a melting pot city like NY.<br/>\n<br/>\nA city like New York introduces many complex and sometimes confusing set of scenarios and situations for medical and emergency care providers. With the use of new techniques and technologies, this app strategy hopes to take some or eliminate (one day) the risk factors out of the equation in helping New York City to provde a standard of quality, efficiency and correctness in medical service to the most vulnerable in need of medical help.<br/>\n<br/>\n= Samsung S2'

S'A mobile app that interfaces with the NYC data sets on NYC Facets (nyc.pediacities.com)<br/>\nThis app crowdsources information for the NYC data sets. Anyone using the app can post information to any of the sets available on NYC Facets. This version uses only three sets as proof of concept, but generically uses the meta data from any set to populate a data entry form that can be summited. I intended to include a photo that could be chosen from the photo library on the iPhone, and submit the photo with the data. Unfortunately, I ran out of time to include the photo aspect of the app. Anyone using the app can check that the data is posted by looking for the dataset on <a href="http://sandboxdw.pediacities.com/user/franw">http://sandboxdw.pediacities.com/user/franw</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo take advantage of the meta-data presented by NYC Facets which represent hundred of NYC datasets, and in the future, many more NYC data sets. This app is innovative in that it generically can post to any dataset on the site, and I intended to also post a photo in BlobData format which the dataset supports, so that the administrators of the data also have a picture. The picture location data is also used to populate many fields of the data, besides lat/lon, as police precinct, etc. making it easy for the user to fill out the data (not all fields are required).<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you are walking around mid-town and you see a leaking hydrant.<br/>\nOr suppose you are somewhere in Brooklyn and you see some graffiti that needs to be cleaned up.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you are a bird watcher, and spot an unusual bird.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpen your Citizen Reporter iPhone app, choose an appropriate data set that you want to post to, enter the data about the situation and submit it.<br/>\nSoon people at the associated department will be alerted to it, and your input (and in the future, a picture) will have joined the public data.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are then on your way, with that warm feeling of having helped your community in your pocket!'

S'It can be tough to decide if an illness or injury requires a trip to ER or a doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nNurs.me is a nurse hotline reinvented, with 3 technologies:<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile in-browser Skype-like calls (based on WebRTC)<br/>\nPersonal Dropbox-like health data locker for controlled sharing with the nurse<br/>\nVital signs sensors / Biometrics (a Fitbit bracelet)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow it works:<br/>\nPatient goes to <a href="http://nurs.me">http://nurs.me</a> to place a video call to a nurse from a smartphone browser, no app install needed (currently Chrome on Android and desktop is supported, Firefox on android and desktop will release WebRTC support in July). <br/>\nA triage nurse answers the call on their smartphone or a tablet and determines the course of action. In addition, personal health locker data and biometrics are overlayed on top of the video, i.e.:<br/>\n<br/>\nState. Patient&#039;s meds, allergies and ills. The nurse can spot a change in meds that caused the adverse effects.<br/>\nHistory. The nurse could check who helped the patient in the past and if necessary, could ask that nurse for help.<br/>\nBiometrics. Fitbit data allows nurse to assess overall alertness/night-rest. More vitals will be added via Amiigo bracelet.<br/>\n<br/>\nA text chat feature allows the nurse to request patient&#039;s location and post a link to nearby health centers; Chat lets the patient paste a photo of his/her symptoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst 3 min are free. Then paypal payment is requested. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy we built it:<br/>\n- As a parent with 2 kids I often found myself guessing on health decisions. I think of nurs.me as a health care AAA.<br/>\n- In case of stroke or a heart attack, delaying the ER visit can turn a person in a pumpkin, which happened to my mother in law.<br/>\n<br/>\nNurs.me addresses BigIssues:<br/>\n1. Jobs &amp; mobility. Help nurses get work with just a smartphone or a tablet. <br/>\n2. Healthy living. Improves healthcare.<br/>\n3. Cleanweb. Decreases the amount of nurse home visits for patients with chronic conditions, like asthma, mental illness, elder homecare.'

It is headed towards being a conceptual mashup of ArcView, MineCraft and Yelp with a focus on meeting community needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can navigate these vital communities in a 3d environment that allows you to experience the neighborhood from a people-scale view. When used as a tool for disaster simulation, multi-modal travel simulation, and multi-agent simulation it will allow for a much more realistic view of bottlenecks and opportunities for optimizations and decision support that a flat map simply can\xe2\x80\x99t offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Far Rockaway scenario you can change the water level and see the effect of rising sea levels due to climate change.

For eaxmple, if the user enters that they have a job , with one click they are taken to the iPhone\xe2\x80\x99s calendar to enter the appontment. <br/>\nA graphical interface of six icons for the different states let\xe2\x80\x99s the job seeker see at a glance where he stands, what he has to do. The next steps are currently: apply, interview, follow-up, waiting, closed, and first week \xe2\x80\x93 as the last one indicates, the app will encourage users to keep using it\xe2\x80\x99s calendar-integration to get to work for those crucial first shifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJob Saver 1.0 is fully-functional, and in this version for the contest entirely self contained within the iPhone.

The old iPhone 4 is now a \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d phone at major cell carriers, and JobSaver is written to be backwards compatible all the way to iPhone 1. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 1.0 app submitted for NYCBigApps is obvioulsy just the beginning. With support (and a badly needed designer, I hope to bring it to other platforms, and include even more features, to help people from all walks of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, JobSaver includes a directory of city\xe2\x80\x9dAgency Service Centers\xe2\x80\x9d, including city agencies such as jobs programs Human Resources Administration and Small Business Services.

S'Finding the right daycare center is one of the most critical decisions any parent will ever make. Sure, location and price are important. But safety is paramount.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NYC Daycare Finder gives parents not only a quick, handy way to locate licensed daycare providers closest to their home or office \xe2\x80\x93 but offers a potent tool to help them make an informed decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe app, using a New York City Department of Health and Mental Services database, allows parents, with a click, to pull up any open or past violations a given center might have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NYC Day Care Finder also provides valuable context in describing the range of seriousness of violations. The app offers the ability to filter, save, and print searches, helping users compare centers when making one of the most important choices of their child\xe2\x80\x99s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe built the app to give the public instant access to this information, which, while available online, isn\xe2\x80\x99t presented in an easily accessible form. Our goal is to create a consumer safety tool for busy parents on-the-go. The app, with its simple, easy-to-use interface, helps parents navigate what can be a daunting and complex process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe app will help NYC parents narrow their daycare choices even before they visit, saving time and effort. Most importantly, the NYC Day Care Finder allows parents to make a better-informed decision before leaving their child in the hands of strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents want to do the best they can for their children. The NYC Day Care Finder offers a new tool to help protect our families.'

S'Health Recovery Solutions has created a Mobile platform to engage and track Congestive Heart Failure patients and provide clinicians and caregivers real-time data on patient status outside the hospital. Using predictive analytics, we help healthcare providers and caregivers identify those patients who are high risk for readmission in order to allow for the proper interventions. This allows for quality outpatient care delivered by the existing inpatient staff. Timely interventions will help to prevent unnecessary 30-day hospital readmissions to avoid costly CMS financial penalties. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe platform focuses on patient education and motivation, medication adherence, weight compliance, physical activity monitoring, and patient symptoms. Coupling these real-time patient measurements with efficient workflow integration and clinician intervention we are able to create an end to end early warning system to prevent readmissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the hospital setting, patients are provided a 4G internet ready tablet pre-loaded with the HRS software (locked to only use the HRS software). Patients utilize the tablet to educate themselves on their condition, using videos, diet information, and teach back quizzes. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt discharge, patients are sent home with the tablet to help track recovery metrics, along with a Withings scale, and pill organizer. Patients are reminded on a daily basis to enter data important to their recovery (medication, weight, physical activity, symptoms, and diet). The data is sent to the cloud in real-time and our predictive analytics allow our system to alert clinicians and caregivers when a patient\xe2\x80\x99s condition is deteriorating so care teams may intervene before a readmission occurs. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe clinicians can receive alerts and view the real-time patient data through several options that integrate seamlessly with their workflow, including a web portal, smartphone app, texts, emails, and EMR integration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe diagnosis of heart failure (HF) costs $29B each year in treatment and carries an approximate 25% readmission rate with a subsequent $12B in Medicare spending. The national average readmission rate for heart failure has remained steady at 20-25% for several years, even as many hospitals have worked harder to lower their individual readmission rate. Studies have shown that more than 50% of these readmissions can be prevented.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn October 2012, CMS initiated a program in which a total of 307 hospitals nationally will lose in penalties, the maximum amount allowed under the health care law: 1% of their base Medicare reimbursements. New York hospitals are heavily affected and include top ranked institutions which service challenging low-income patient populations. The penalty rates will subsequently increase by 1% every year until 2015.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly post discharge clinics are growing in numbers since there is data showing that an early visit can prevent the return to the hospital. However, patient populations may be difficult to reach for multiple reasons, including lack of transportation or absence of a healthcare giver to assist the patient in his care. <br/>\n<br/>\nProviders are not properly equipped to efficiently monitor and deliver care to a large outpatient population. The HRS platform will enable providers in NYC such as Montefiore or NYU Langone to utilize their existing staff to deliver world class care to their Medicare population in an outpatient setting. With a focus on Interventions to reinforce patient education, ensure compliance with diet, weight, medications, and identify recurrent symptoms amenable to treatment on an outpatient basis, the HRS platform will not only be able to prevent readmissions but provide patients with a better quality of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur app will not only enable NYC residents better manage their chronic conditions but allow their families to better keep an eye on them, along with allowing NYC healthcare providers to provide patients with better quality of care'

S'Hopscotch is an iPad programming language for teaching kids to code. It is the first ever language designed specifically to be programmed on a mobile device. Kids can use the friendly touch-screen interface to drag and drop blocks of code into scripts and create their own games and apps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs coding becomes the new literacy, kids will need a way to begin to learn to program. However, most programming languages have complicated syntax rules, making them hard for kids to grasp. With Hopscotch, kids can create software scripts and build projects with zero typing. It&#039;s like legos for software--part tool, part toy, part learning experience. Not only will kids grasp the fundamentals of computer science, they&#039;ll also gain valuable algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills, all while building their own fun projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nMayor Bloomberg is trying to make NYC a hub for innovation and technology. A necessary component of the technology ecosystem is a healthy supply of engineers. However, most of our schools aren&#039;t teaching computer science or producing students that will go into engineering careers. Not only is this problematic for the tech ecosystem here, it means that the majority of kids going to NYC public schools will miss out on these lucrative jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopscotch helps by providing a non-intimidating way for kids to get started learning computing concepts. Many schools--even the most low-income ones-- have iPads in the classroom. By allowing kids to build their own games and apps without spending time learning the syntax of a typed language, Hopscotch gives kids confidence in their ability to grasp engineering concepts. Some proportion of these kids will go onto careers in engineering.'

S'Car BFF makes maintaining your car simple. We built a mobile app that lets you find the service you need by searching shops based on operating hours, services and specialties, dealership or independent, and even motorcycle repair. Never miss scheduled maintenance and annual inspections again.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew York City has one of the best urban transit systems in the world, yet 1/2 of all NYC households own a car. Driving is the single most polluting activity for most people. Keeping a car properly maintained can reduce its environmental footprint by almost 40%! We wanted to address a real environmental issue by making it easier for people to keep their cars operating properly and as cleanly as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people delay routine maintenance, often having it performed only in order to pass annual inspection because it is easy to forget and because finding a convenient, reputable shop is actually quite difficult. Staying on top of maintenance is not only good for your car, it truly can reduce your contribution to pollution.'

S'I&#039;m making an app for the NYC Big App Competition called City Secrets. City Secrets crowd sources local knowledge to help people get the most and discover the best in New York City. City Secrets offers fun, fast sound bites filled with recommendations for urban escapes, local favorites, timeless classics, and much more in the categories of arts/culture, nature/outdoors, history/landmarks, food/drink, nightlife/shopping. Listen up and explore the city like you never have before!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#039;m making this app because I believe that what makes New York City unique is its diverse people and its unlike-anywhere-on-earth places. When you talk to New Yorkers about what they love about the city, you uncover unexpected pleasures that help you appreciate this town in a whole new way. The app encourages locals to explore parts of the city they might not otherwise visit, and helps tourists find off-the-beaten path sites that in standard tour guides. The problem this app aims to solve is that of making it fun for New Yorkers and tourists to travel outside familiar and famous neighborhoods and, in so doing, improve their health (using the new bike share to get around) and improving the economic viability of small businesses (such as restaurants and bars) in outer borough neighborhoods by increasing customers to their locations.<br/>\n<br/>\nCity Secrets improves life for New York City residents and visitors by helping them learn about New York by listening to the voices of the people who live here. It encourages people to travel farther afield than they might otherwise, especially to the city&#039;s outer boroughs. The app supports bike and foot travel to improve people&#039;s health. It provides a financial boost to small businesses, by literally putting them on the map. And it sparks renewed interest in New York&#039;s lesser-known parks, landmarks, and historical sites, by bringing these places to life with the help of eight million passionate tour guides! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe app will become economically viable by recruiting businesses that receive audio recommendations on the site to pay for the ability to offer coupons to customers exclusively via the app. We will also explore the option of making available a limited number of sound bites to users via an initial free version, while making available a much wider data set to those who pay a reasonable price for an upgraded version.'

S'A New York City based nonprofit, incorporated in New York State, The FraMiATi Foundation is developing BigDada.Me to improve the lives of under-served New Yorkers by providing them with the basic job skills that are in demand today and those that are needed in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nBigDada.Me is a gamified workforce solution that uses games, quizzes and challenges to engage users in learning technical skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nBigDada.Me is currently a web application that incorporates gamification into workforce training. The iPhone and Android apps are soon to follow. BigDada.Me used various open databases to build a solution that is both practical &amp; engaging. BigDada.Me features searchable maps to free &amp; nearly free computers throughout NYC so that participants in the challenges can practice skill on office equipment. In addition, BigDada.Me encourages participants to visit Workforce1 centers so that they can &quot;Level Up&quot; with hands on guidance from counselors.<br/>\n<br/>\nBigDada.Me is designed for a population that is not reached by traditional methods of instruction. An interactive application, BigDada.Me will provide both opportunities for economic mobility and life-long learning for New Yorkers as well as others that access the application globally.<br/>\n<br/>\nMentoring and career-coaching have been centerpieces of the efforts of the leaders of the Framiati Foundation &amp; BigDada.Me is a means to reach a larger audience in that regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany New Yorkers do not have the necessary workforce skills to staff open entry-level positions in New York City. The Foundation is developing this application to empower that population with the job skills that will facilitate their economic mobility in the near term and in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nA multi-faceted application, BigDada.Me also employs traditional &amp; social media engagement to facilitate users access and participation at public events - specifically through its &quot;Gamer Outreach&quot; component.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all fun &amp; games, users are encourage to study the jargon of business as a means to winning the challenge as well as participate in &quot;live&quot; webinars.'
