Datasets
========

For Clean.Data. to work we need a relatively comprehensive map of datasets and the connections between them. This project is focused on solving that problem.

Check out the Examples directory for example scraping code, and for the format of the output dataset listing. Please stick closely to the dataformat as this will be fed into the live database for the project.

### To Start a Working on a New Directory

* Pick one of the outstanding dataset locations from the Issues list
* Comment that you're working on it, and create a new directory with the name of the site you're working on in the name
* Use that directory to store your parsing code as well as your output.
* Make notes on any problems you're having with the site, so that others can help out, and we know how complete/incomplete the map is.
