            "description": "This survey includes data from the Enqu\u00eate des Petits Producteurs (Small Farmer Survey) carried out by IFPRI and LARES (Laboratoire d'Analyse Regionale et d'Expertise Sociale, Cotonou, Republic of Benin). The objectives were to describe rural livelihoods, examine how conditions for farmers have changed over time, and assess the impact of agricultural reforms on rural households. The training of enumerators, field testing of the survey and final revision of the questionnaire took place in June-July 1998. The survey itself was carried out over the period August to November 1998. The households were selected using a two-stage stratified random sample procedure based on the 1997 Pre-Census of Agriculture. In each of the six departments, villages randomly selected, with the number of villages proportional to the volume of agricultural production, subject to a minimum of 10 villages per department. In total, 100 villages were selected. In each village, nine households were randomly selected using listed prepared for the pre-Census. Three alternative households were selected for each village in case one or more of the nine were unavailable. In a few villages, the number of interviewed households was eight or ten, resulting in a final sample size of 899 farm households. \r\n\r\nTopics addressed in the survey include household and land characteristics, crop production, main agricultural activities, use of fertilizers and other inputs, source of credit, sale and use of crops, storage, consumption, time allocation, and sources of income as well as community level data on transport structure, marketing of agricultural products, village groups, agricultural production, extension services, and formal/informal credit. \r\n\r\nThe survey was conducted in collaboration with Laboratoire d'Analyse R\u00e9gionale et d'Expertise Sociale, Cotonou, Republic of Benin (LARES). Funding for the survey was provided by Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaflitche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ).",

            "description": "In the thermal hydraulic experiments to determinate parameters of heat transfer, where fuel rod simulators are heated by electric current, the preservation of the simulators are essential when the heat flux goes to the critical point. One of the most important limits in the design of cooling water reactors is the condition that the heat transfer co-efficiently by boiling in the core to deteriorate itself. The heat flux just before deterioration is denominated as critical heat flux (CHF). At this time the small increase in the heat flux or in the inlet temperature of the cooler in the core, or the small decrease in the inlet flux of cooling, results in changes in the heat transfer mechanism. This causes increases in the surface temperature of the fuel elements leading to failures at the fuel (burnout). This paper describes the experiments conducted to detection of critical heat flux in nuclear fuel element simulators carried out in the thermal-hydraulic laboratory of Nuclear Technology Development Centre (CDTN). It is concluded that the use of displacement transducer is the most efficient technique for detecting critical heat flux in nuclear simulators heated by electric current in open pool.

            "description": "Numerical simulation was carried out to study the turbulent mixing behaviour of two opposite flows inside a square chimney model of a pool type research reactor. This type of chimney structure is often used for open pool type reactors to prevent mixing of core outlet water directly into the pool. The chimney design facilitates guiding of the radioactive water from the reactor core towards the side outlet nozzles and simultaneously allows drawing water from the reactor pool through the chimney top opening. This helps to limit the radioactivity level at the pool top to a lower limit. The present work aims at studying the turbulent mixing inside a 2/9th scaled down model of chimney structure. The Reynolds numbers considered in the simulation are 1.36\u00d7106, 1.81\u00d7106, 2.26\u00d7106 and 2.72\u00d7106 which correspond to upward core flow of 12.5, 16.67, 20.83 and 25 kg/s respectively. The core bypass flow which is sucked in the downward direction varies to 0, 5, 10 and 15% of the core flow. The effects of flow ratio between the upward flow and downward flow on the mixing behaviour are analysed using PHOENICS code. Turbulence is modelled by using the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation. The results indicate that increase in downward flow causes the jet height to decrease. It is observed that the jet height mainly depends on the ratio of core bypass flow and core flow. The effect of change on core flow is insignificant.

            "description": "Recently, the growing awareness on health accelerates the demand for seafoods worldwide. Freshness of seafoods tends to be prior requirement. For the assessment on freshness of seafoods, so far, sensory, microbiological\u3000and biochemical methods are used. However, these are not appropriate method for large quantities. In this case, optical methods have advantages of quickness and nondestruction. In this review, biochemical changes during storage are described as a theoretical basis of the freshness evaluation and several current topics on optical noninvasive methods are introduced. Fluorescence of NADH has been applied to scallop adductor muscle, which showed that transient increase in fluorescence intensity was followed by the decrease until 2days of observation . Based on absorption spectra of squid hemocyanin, the oxygen dissociation curve shifted to the left during storage,which suggested that the affinity of oxygen depends on freshness. As for the transparency of squid mantle, new technology with transmittance permitted to analyze the changes to turbid state. The results were almost consistent with that obtained from the sensory test. The range applied to these new methods is still narrow but many results obtained would be reported in the near future.

            "description": "Industrial wet phosphoric acid production in Tunisia has led to the accumulation of high amounts of waste phosphogypsum by-products which are stocked mainly in piles. This harmful waste has still caused much anxiety and problems for the living especially in Sfax region (South-East of Tunisia) where it is rejected. In this paper two samples of Tunisian phosphogypsum, differing in their age, were analyzed by different analytical methods in order to compare and study the effect of impurities presence on gypsum\u2019s properties. Infrared spectroscopy allowed the observation of phosphoric acid and fluorosilicates absorption bands as well as the determination of the P/S ratio. X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the presence of impurities of HPO42- (crystallized in ardealite and brushite phases) and SiF62- (crystallized in malladrite phase) in phosphogypsum samples. A shaped-needles phase observed only in old sample micrographs corresponded to the brushite phase. Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis showed the influence of impurities on the thermal behavior of dehydrated calcium sulfate. Elemental analysis was provided with respect to scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray technique, X-ray fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and selective electrode analysis. Optical properties investigated by photoluminescence measurements allowed not only the identification of the matrix emissions but also the observation of Cd2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ impurities showing thus their presence in the studied phosphogypsum samples.

Institutions of Higher Education, however, have different IT requirements. These differences are determined partly by the type of hardware and software that they use. At a time when business entities are striving to minimize costs without compromising the quality of services rendered, the choice as to what software to acquire must reflect considerations such as costs, infrastructure, equipment, management, accessibility and modernity. These are the advantages that are borne with the acquisition of a VMware View, used for the creation of a virtual desktop. The School of Law at the University of the Witwatersrand is the first School within the university to use VMware; and among the first within the Southern African region. Just as recently introduced, its impact is already being felt in different aspects \u2013 cost minimization, minimal utilization of space, efficacy, etc. Personal experiences, informal conversations with other users within and outside the university community, dictate to us the unbeatable advantages and benefits of using VMware.

The optimum detector for MUD is the Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, but its complexity is very high and involves an exhaustive search to reach the best fitness of the transmitted and received data. Thus, there has been considerable interest in suboptimal multiuser detectors with less complexity and reasonable performance. If we look to the problem from an optimization viewpoint, what makes our work difficult is high interaction and Epistasis among variables which should be optimized. We propose to work on the problem and try to reduce its complexity instead of using more complex and powerful optimization algorithms. To do so, we analyze problem carefully and propose a new method to overcome Epistasis. In this paper, by using sign detector and longer code lengths in DS/CDMA system, a simple detector will be proposed. This method is compared with ML and two model-free optimization methods: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms which have been used for MUD in DS/CDMA. Simulation results show our method dramatic efficiency.

Individual nodes are responsible for dynamically discovering other nodes that they can directly communicate with. Communication between nodes may be achieved by means of Route Discovery and maintenance. Because of mobility nature, discovery task is more complex. A black hole is a malicious node that falsely replies to any route requests without having active route to specified destination and drops all the receiving packets. Black Hole Attack can be easily deployed by the adversary. If these malicious nodes work together as a group then the damage will be very serious. This type of attack is called cooperative black hole attack. A neighborhood based method to detect whether there exists a black hole attack and a routing recovery protocol to set up a correct path to the true destination. We propose a complete protocol to detect a chain of cooperating malicious nodes in an ad hoc network that disrupts transmission of data by feeding wrong routing information. In this model, the nodes authenticate each other by issuing security certificate with digital signature to all the other nodes in the network. This model is capable of detecting and removing black hole nodes in the MANET also with a secured route discovery by means of an algorithm termed as endairA algorithm.

In this paper, it is shown that a cubic B-spline filter can be used to improve the non-linear image enhancement method. In the non-linear image enhancement, a higher-frequency component can be predicted to solve the blurred problem of an enlarged image. This paper also presents a new three-dimensional (3-D) down-scaling scheme to subsample video data for video coding. Furthermore, a novel non-linear image-enhancement compensation algorithm with cubic B-spline filter is presented to improve the prediction of higher-frequency component and accordingly the efficiency of the 3-D down-scaling video coding. Finally, a computer simulation shows that the proposed method yields a better quality of the decoded image than other non-linear enhancement methods.

Nevertheless, they are usually chosen due to their simplicity and not their performance as they are not always suitable compared to the human observer. In this work we present a Rate-Distortion approach to color image compression based on subband transforms using perceptual optimization of the compression quality. This approach is based on minimization of the Weighted Mean Square Error (WMSE) of the encoded image, which better corresponds to the quality assessment of the human eye. The WMSE can be measured in the YCbCr color space, for which visual weights are relatively easily derived. Based on the new approach, new optimized compression algorithms are introduced using the Discrete Cosine Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. We compare the new algorithms to presently available algorithms such as JPEG and JPEG2000. Our conclusion is that the new WMSE optimization approach outperforms presently available compression systems when a human observer is considered.

Recharge pits, made up of readily available materials, are a simple, cost effective and satisfactory method for recharging ground water storage where an impermeable layer does not allow natural charge of ground water. Recharge pits of rectangular shape (1.7 x 1.4m) with depth of 1.80 m were dug and constructed in series in a micro watershed of area 1.78 hectare in Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh, India. Experimental studies were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and results indicated that logarithmic equations were best fitted for determining the rate of ground water recharge in Eastern Nimar valley region. It was also observed that about 32.74% of runoff may be allowed for ground water recharge by adopting the method. The findings of the study may be adopted for planning and management of ground water by the different stakeholders in water scarce area or where ground water is becoming a scarce resource.

            "description": "The objective of this research is to compare dry anaerobic digestion of cow dung for methane production with wet anaerobic digestion under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures in batch cultures for 63 days. The results showed that a specific methane yield of 0.333 and 0.345 LCH4/gVSr was obtained at 35oC in the fermentation systems for a dilute ratio of 1:1 and 1:0, with a VS removal of 50.01%, and 56.33%, a COD removal of 54.99%, and 61.35%, respectively. When the fermentation systems was performed under 55oC, the specific methane yield was increased to 0.351 and 0.374 LCH4/gVSr, with a VS removal of 53.43% and 60.52%, and a COD removal of 58.37% and 65.36%, respectively. Though addition of water could promote start-up process and biodegradability of the substrate to some extent, the methane yields in the dry anaerobic digestion process were found comparable to the conventional wet anaerobic digestion process. Furthermore, the volume of the reactor was increased twice in the wet fermentation process (7.68% TS) of cow dung compared to the dry fermentation (15.18% TS) at the same loading rate. It was suggested that dry methane fermentation process was superior in energy recovery, saving resources and engineering investment compared with wet fermentation process.

The water quality index was calculated using indicator parameters viz., pH, turbidity, temperature, nitrates, total phosphate, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total solids, faecal coliforms with respect to its different uses like residential and commercial, as well as indicator parameters, in addition, index value was compared with quality rating to examine the seasonal variation in groundwater quality. The water quality index was observed from 74.0 to 83.0 and 63.0 to 78.0 in pre and post monsoon season, respectively. Our finding indicates that 100 percent (70 samples) groundwater samples were of desirable quality in pre monsoon season but 30 percent (21 samples) of all showed the quality change from well to less fair in post monsoon season, this seasonal variation in water quality rating has indicated the deterioration of water quality in the study area, thus indicating a need of proper treatment before use.

Investigations have been carried out by climatologists to find a possible relation of climate change with anthropogenic behavior by studying trends in different climatic parameters. However, the changes are not the same for all regions especially in India due to localized intensity, thus it must be quantified locally to manage the natural resources. Temperature, one of the most important components of climatic parameter, has been widely measured as a starting point towards the apprehension of climate changes courses. The main purpose of this study is to observe the temporal variability of temperature for the period of 1901-2002 (102 years), to improve the hydrological status of Upper Ganga Canal Command located in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as to determine trend in annual mean and monthly Temperature time series using nonparametric methods (i.e. the Mann\u2013Kendall and Sen\u2019s Slope tests). The magnitudes of trend in a Temperature time series have been estimated by Sen\u2019s estimator method. Auto correlation effect is reduced from the Temperature series before the application of the Mann\u2013Kendall test. On annual basis, the analysis of Mann\u2013Kendall test shows increasing (positive) non-significance trend in temperature time series over Upper Ganga Canal Command. Thus, in the study area, the temperature is increasing, which leads to the increment in evaporation, warmer days and nights in summer.

The estimation of the control horizon can be computed quickly. From the numerical simulations, the new algorithm has the small conservation and computational complexity.",

Factors were divided in eighteen groups: capital, land, and sixteen categories of labor. The labor force was divided into skilled and unskilled labor, both disaggregated by whether a person works in the tradables or nontradables sector, whether he/she works in an urban or rural area, and by gender. Institutions were comprised of households, the government, an enterprise account and the rest of the world. Households were divided into four categories according to degree of urbanization and educational level of the head of household: urban/rural families whose head has/has not completed at least ninth grade.",
