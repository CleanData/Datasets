Institutions of Higher Education, however, have different IT requirements. These differences are determined partly by the type of hardware and software that they use. At a time when business entities are striving to minimize costs without compromising the quality of services rendered, the choice as to what software to acquire must reflect considerations such as costs, infrastructure, equipment, management, accessibility and modernity. These are the advantages that are borne with the acquisition of a VMware View, used for the creation of a virtual desktop. The School of Law at the University of the Witwatersrand is the first School within the university to use VMware; and among the first within the Southern African region. Just as recently introduced, its impact is already being felt in different aspects \u2013 cost minimization, minimal utilization of space, efficacy, etc. Personal experiences, informal conversations with other users within and outside the university community, dictate to us the unbeatable advantages and benefits of using VMware.

The optimum detector for MUD is the Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, but its complexity is very high and involves an exhaustive search to reach the best fitness of the transmitted and received data. Thus, there has been considerable interest in suboptimal multiuser detectors with less complexity and reasonable performance. If we look to the problem from an optimization viewpoint, what makes our work difficult is high interaction and Epistasis among variables which should be optimized. We propose to work on the problem and try to reduce its complexity instead of using more complex and powerful optimization algorithms. To do so, we analyze problem carefully and propose a new method to overcome Epistasis. In this paper, by using sign detector and longer code lengths in DS/CDMA system, a simple detector will be proposed. This method is compared with ML and two model-free optimization methods: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms which have been used for MUD in DS/CDMA. Simulation results show our method dramatic efficiency.\r\n ( International Journal of Communications (IJC) is an internationally refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in communications research.

Individual nodes are responsible for dynamically discovering other nodes that they can directly communicate with. Communication between nodes may be achieved by means of Route Discovery and maintenance. Because of mobility nature, discovery task is more complex. A black hole is a malicious node that falsely replies to any route requests without having active route to specified destination and drops all the receiving packets. Black Hole Attack can be easily deployed by the adversary. If these malicious nodes work together as a group then the damage will be very serious. This type of attack is called cooperative black hole attack. A neighborhood based method to detect whether there exists a black hole attack and a routing recovery protocol to set up a correct path to the true destination. We propose a complete protocol to detect a chain of cooperating malicious nodes in an ad hoc network that disrupts transmission of data by feeding wrong routing information. In this model, the nodes authenticate each other by issuing security certificate with digital signature to all the other nodes in the network. This model is capable of detecting and removing black hole nodes in the MANET also with a secured route discovery by means of an algorithm termed as endairA algorithm.\r\n ( International Journal of Communications (IJC) is an internationally refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in communications research.

This paper also presents a new three-dimensional (3-D) down-scaling scheme to subsample video data for video coding. Furthermore, a novel non-linear image-enhancement compensation algorithm with cubic B-spline filter is presented to improve the prediction of higher-frequency component and accordingly the efficiency of the 3-D down-scaling video coding. Finally, a computer simulation shows that the proposed method yields a better quality of the decoded image than other non-linear enhancement methods.

Nevertheless, they are usually chosen due to their simplicity and not their performance as they are not always suitable compared to the human observer. In this work we present a Rate-Distortion approach to color image compression based on subband transforms using perceptual optimization of the compression quality. This approach is based on minimization of the Weighted Mean Square Error (WMSE) of the encoded image, which better corresponds to the quality assessment of the human eye. The WMSE can be measured in the YCbCr color space, for which visual weights are relatively easily derived. Based on the new approach, new optimized compression algorithms are introduced using the Discrete Cosine Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. We compare the new algorithms to presently available algorithms such as JPEG and JPEG2000. Our conclusion is that the new WMSE optimization approach outperforms presently available compression systems when a human observer is considered.\r\n ( International Journal of Communications (IJC) is an internationally refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in communications research.

These contaminants pose a risk of poisoning the catalyst beds, as well decreasing the overall sulfur recovery. In this paper, effect of reaction furnace and converter temperatures on performance of SRUs is described. Then, the common ways for adjusting these important parameters are presented for a typical sulfur recovery unit. The achieved results can be useful for designing the new Claus sulfur recovery units.

Because of the permeability differences in the rock reservoir, a large part of the fluid injected can migrate to undesired regions. Therefore, viscous fluids are used to modify the permeability of certain regions of the rock formation. The products added to the fluids that provide this characteristic are called divergent agents. There are a large number of commercial products that can be used for this purpose, but the fluids prepared with them must have special properties. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these products in advance. This work examines the chemical structure and physic-chemical properties of commercial surfactants to identify those with potential application as divergent agents. To do this, the rheological behaviour of the commercial formulations was tested considering temperature and pH conditions typical of reservoirs.

Paraffin/polyurethane foams composite with flame retardant as thermal energy storage materials were prepared by absorbing paraffin in honeycomb structure of polyurethane rigid foams. These composites provide a new energy saving materials, which can be used for building heating/cooling systems, and the composites can also enhance the thermal comfort for residents. In the composites, paraffin was used as the phase change material (PCM), polyurethane (PU) rigid foams acting as the supporting material, or as nano-structured calcium carbonate (nano-CC) and red phosphorus (RP) acting as the flame retardant. The thermal properties, such as phase change temperature and latent heat, were investigated by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Chemical structure, micro-structure and flame retardant properties of paraffin/ polyurethane foams composite were determined by FT-IR, SEM and limited oxygen index (LOI) tester, respectively. The SEM results showed that paraffin was well dispersed in honeycomb structure of polyurethane rigid foams. The DSC results indicated that the composites melt at 80.3\u2103 with a latent heat of 25.8kJ/kg when the mass percentage of paraffin in the composites was 16.7%. The LOI results showed that nano-CC and RP decreased the flammability of the composites.

            "description": "Eccentric cementing status always occurs in the period of well completion in complex formation. Under this condition, buckling failure of casing has greater impact on normal production. According to adjacent balance criterion and higher differential equation, a determination method of buckling load for eccentric cementing casing was established. This avoids complex modeling and discretization processes when determining the critical buckling load of casing, and geometrical and physical parameters can directly be put in the formula of critical buckling load. There exists 8.3% relative error, comparing critical load from the formula with the result by using finite element method. That means the results are accurate. This method has the advantage of direct calculation and is easy for engineering applications without complex modeling and discretization processes.

The catalyst pellet used in this reactor was Co-Mo/Al2O3. At first, using the experimental data, a power law kinetic model was developed for hydrodesulphurization reaction. Then a pseudo-homogeneous two-dimensional dynamic model was proposed to describe the concentration profile in the reactor bed. The simulation obtained with the proposed dynamic model showed good agreement with experimental data and the sulfur concentration error in the reactor outlet was 3.8 percent compared to the experimental data. Two dimension modeling revealed that the radial variation of sulfur concentration is more in the reactor inlet than the outlet, but in general the concentration profile can be considered in one dimension. Unsteady reactor modeling showed that the transition time was higher in the reactor outlet and estimated to be 11667 seconds.

A five-level-four-factorial Central Composite Design (CCD) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the process variables for minimizing the FFA of JCO and maximizing the JCB (%) yield. The high FFA (14.6%) of JCO could be reduced to 0.34% by its pretreatment with methanol (6.5:1) using H2SO4 as catalyst (1.5% v/v) in 125 min time at 50oC temperature. A JCB yield of 98.3% was achieved with methanol/oil molar ratio (11:1) using NaOH as catalyst (1% w/w) in 110 min time at 55oC temperature. Second-order model equations were obtained to predict the FFA content and JCB yield as a function of input parameters. The models can be successfully adopted in fuel industry to reduce the FFA content of JCO and maximize the yield of methyl esters, thereby, improving the economy of the process. The prepared JCB conformed to the ASTM and IS standards specifications.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

            "description": "Sand production like water and gas production is one of the perennial problems plaguing the oil industry because of its safety, economics or environmental impact on production. In order to properly optimise production and monitor sand controlled well, it is imperative to evaluate the well performance, sand control effectiveness and durability of the treatment type installed in order to achieve the main aim of hydrocarbon production. The principal methods of sand control that are available to oil industry in Nigeria are internal gravel pack (IGP) and sand control using chemicals (SCON). This paper compares the principal methods of sand control measures installed in terms of their effect on performance, durability and sand control effectiveness in Niger Delta. Production and well data from 10 different wells were gotten for their flow rate, sand production and water production. Actual and ideal productivity index are calculated. Well inflow quality indicator (WIQI) was used as a criteria to determine the performance of the well for their treatment types. A graph of the production data was plotted against time (years). A bar chart of the treatment type before installation is plotted against time (years) and also a bar chart of sand produced after the treatment type installed was made to determine the durability and sand production effectiveness of the treatment types installed. The result show that SCON wells have better performance than IGP wells with WIQI values ranges from 0.6 \u2013 1 to that of 0.2 \u2013 0.6 for IGP wells. SCON wells recorded 2-4 years to that of 6 \u2013 12 years of IGP wells for durability. SCON wells recorded sand production of about 55Ib/1000bbl, to that of 34Ib/1000bbl, for IGP wells after their installations. Based on these findings IGP wells are recommended for Niger Delta formation.

Two microbial cultures, coded as NW O and CW O, showed an accelerated growth and higher CO2 production when molasses were used as carbon source. They were selected and identified by molecular-biology techniques as potential candidates to be used in future Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery studies. To improve CO2 production, a reformulated culture medium was evaluated using only the culture coded as NW O which showed the better growth. Results showed that the reformulated culture medium caused an increase in the production of CO2 from 1.64gL-1to 3.13 gL-1 by the NW O culture. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries allowed the identification of fermentative microorganisms; the NW O culture is composed of Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and Thermotoga neapolitana; the CW O culture is composed of Caldanaerobacter subterraneus.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

            "description": "Several parameters affect the chemical reactions between CO2/fluid/rock: pressure, temperature, rock type, and brine composition. Brine composition includes salt concentration and type. Pink Desert limestone cores were used to conduct a series of coreflood experiments to address the effect of brine composition on the chemical reactions between carbonic acid and limestone rock. The experiments were designed to simulate the water alternating gas (WAG) injection of CO2 into saline carbonate aquifers. Supercritical CO2 and brines were injected at flow rates of 2 and 5 cm3/min at 70 and 200&amp;#176;F. Seawater, formation brine, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride brines were used in this study. A commercial compositional simulator was used to simulate the coreflood experiments at the lab conditions. The reaction rate constant of CO2 with calcite at different brine compositions was adjusted to match the calcium concentration obtained in the lab. Experimental data was used to predict the reaction rate constant between CO2/brine/rock and found to be increasing as the brine salinity increased (Log(k25)= -9.2) when CO2 dissolves in DI water, and -6.2 when CO2 dissolves in 5 wt% CaCl2 brine). A simulation study conducted on field scale showed that after 30 years of CO2 injection and 1400 years after injection stopped, brine composition does not affect the trapping mechanism of CO2 in the aquifer.

Considering the process of chemical adsorption in layers, it managed to show that when the fluid flows into the reservoir, even moderate magnitudes of over balance internal electromagnetic radiation occur. Under the influence of this radiation, certain order of direction and intensity oscillations of phonons is set. Regard to borehole maximum intensity, oscillations of phonons will take place in the zone of high tangential stresses. Therefore, at some depth from the borehole, wall rock will be destroyed into particles commensurable with clay. Behind the transition layer due to throw of electromagnetic energy into the reservoir and fluid, mass transfer from the periphery of the reservoir to an extended zone with stepwise increased porosity and high thermodynamic compressibility of fluid is formed. Inside this zone a strong and long-range interaction between particles of fluid is developing. Throw in of electromagnetic energy is a result of intensive electromagnetic radiation due to the inflow into the reservoir mud or kill fluid. This formation is called the associate. The associate emits electromagnetic waves that change over allogenic particles in porous medium beyond the associate in the excited state. Between associate and excited particle strong interaction set in, which manifested in attraction of particle to the associate, and it becomes a full member of the associate. Thus, there is a selective implication of allogenic fluid particles into the associate.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

It is observed that the cationic surfactants induced cooperative binding with the anionic polyelectrolyte at critical aggregation concentration (cac) and the cac values are considerably lower than the corresponding critical micelle concentration (cmc) for each of the surfactant irrespective of their hydrophobic tail size. The cmc of surfactants were observed at slightly higher surfactant concentration in polyelectrolyte solution than that in pure water. It was found that the surfactants with longer tail size strongly favour the interaction with NaCMC, indicating the dependence of aggregation phenomenon on the tail size of the surfactants.

Comparative performance cooling curve of a number of vegetable oil basestocks commercially available in Brazil was reported previously. These basestocks included: soybean, canola, corn, cottonseed and sunflower oils. However, these particular vegetable oils exhibit very poor thermal-oxidative stability, relative to petroleum oil, which is attributable to their molecular composition. To address this specific deficiency which affects long-term performance, a number of additional vegetable oils with much more favorable molecular structure were examined including: peanuit (groundnut) oil and coconut oil. To assess the quenching performance compared to conventional and accelerated quenching oils, cooling curve performance according to ASTM D6200 for two bath temperatures (60 &#176;C and 90 &#176;C) was determined. In addition, effective heat transfer coefficients were calculated and compared. It is noteworthy that the vegetable oils evaluated did not exhibit classical film boiling or nucleate boiling behavior during quenching.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

Data were gathered during a period of four months in two horizontal well of an oil field with the aim of assessing the relationship between Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and drilling efficiency trough the analysis of the most significant drilling parameters. There are several models and measurement systems available for measuring such parameters, however in many practical cases the possible maximum performances are not achieved and this suggests the idea that there is still room, from a research point of view, to increase acquisition accuracy and their correct evaluation. In this study, down hole data were acquired to calculate significant parameters for assessing drilling performances which can contribute to the avoidance of errors in torque calculation due to the effect of drill string friction and the consequent distortion of MSE curve. Moreover, the same data implemented in a model for Rate of Penetration (ROP) calculation and a map correlating RPM and Weight on Bit (WOB) values with Rate of Penetration was drawn.

The membranes were made via solution casting on water surface (as non solvent). After studying the effects of different parameters on the membranes morphology, it was found that the mixture of (1 n-butanol/ 3 iso-propyl alcohol), temperature range from 70-800C and polymer concentration range from 4-7 wt could be used to obtain uniform membranes. PV separation of ETB/water mixtures was carried out using these membranes. The results showed that with increasing ETB concentration, both total permeation flux and ETB separation factor increase. Increasing temperature, in the studied limited range, resulted in decreasing separation factor and increasing permeation flux. With decreasing permeate pressure, permeation flux increased and separation factor decreased. Overall mass transfer coefficient was evaluated using steady state ETB permeation flux equation. Membrane mass transfer coefficient, boundary layer thickness and liquid boundary layer mass transfer coefficient were calculated using the modified concentration polarization equation and the resistance in series model. Concentration polarization index (using membrane and liquid boundary layer mass transfer coefficients) was defined and used to present extent of the concentration polarization phenomenon. The modified Arrhenius model was used to correlate ETB permeation flux and the operating temperature. Good agreement was observed between the experimental results and the model predictions. Results showed that the effect of temperature on sorption is greater than that on diffusion.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

Changes of the relative permeability curves before and after injecting surfactants with different interfacial tensions were contrasted. The relative permeability curves of water flooding had the following characteristics: relatively narrower two-phase region, lower water relative permeability at residual oil saturation, higher residual oil saturation(37.6%, 39.7% and 40.5%, respectively), and lower ultimate oil recovery(only 37.3%, 27.8% and 23.6%, respectively). While oil/water interfacial tension decreased from 16mN/m to 7.1&#215;10-4mN/m, the two-phase region became wider, and residual oil saturation decreased. At the same time, water relative permeability at residual oil saturation increased, and ultimate oil recovery increased by 13.6%, 15.6% and 16.4% respectively. And the lower the interfacial tension is, the better the effect of enhancing oil recovery is. In general, surfactants have a great application prospect on the oil field development of low and extremely low permeability reservoir, and the oil-water interfacial tension should be reduced as far as possible.

Recharge pits, made up of readily available materials, are a simple, cost effective and satisfactory method for recharging ground water storage where an impermeable layer does not allow natural charge of ground water. Recharge pits of rectangular shape (1.7 x 1.4m) with depth of 1.80 m were dug and constructed in series in a micro watershed of area 1.78 hectare in Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh, India. Experimental studies were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and results indicated that logarithmic equations were best fitted for determining the rate of ground water recharge in Eastern Nimar valley region. It was also observed that about 32.74% of runoff may be allowed for ground water recharge by adopting the method. The findings of the study may be adopted for planning and management of ground water by the different stakeholders in water scarce area or where ground water is becoming a scarce resource.

            "description": "The objective of this research is to compare dry anaerobic digestion of cow dung for methane production with wet anaerobic digestion under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures in batch cultures for 63 days. The results showed that a specific methane yield of 0.333 and 0.345 LCH4/gVSr was obtained at 35oC in the fermentation systems for a dilute ratio of 1:1 and 1:0, with a VS removal of 50.01%, and 56.33%, a COD removal of 54.99%, and 61.35%, respectively. When the fermentation systems was performed under 55oC, the specific methane yield was increased to 0.351 and 0.374 LCH4/gVSr, with a VS removal of 53.43% and 60.52%, and a COD removal of 58.37% and 65.36%, respectively. Though addition of water could promote start-up process and biodegradability of the substrate to some extent, the methane yields in the dry anaerobic digestion process were found comparable to the conventional wet anaerobic digestion process. Furthermore, the volume of the reactor was increased twice in the wet fermentation process (7.68% TS) of cow dung compared to the dry fermentation (15.18% TS) at the same loading rate. It was suggested that dry methane fermentation process was superior in energy recovery, saving resources and engineering investment compared with wet fermentation process.

Investigations have been carried out by climatologists to find a possible relation of climate change with anthropogenic behavior by studying trends in different climatic parameters. However, the changes are not the same for all regions especially in India due to localized intensity, thus it must be quantified locally to manage the natural resources. Temperature, one of the most important components of climatic parameter, has been widely measured as a starting point towards the apprehension of climate changes courses. The main purpose of this study is to observe the temporal variability of temperature for the period of 1901-2002 (102 years), to improve the hydrological status of Upper Ganga Canal Command located in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as to determine trend in annual mean and monthly Temperature time series using nonparametric methods (i.e. the Mann\u2013Kendall and Sen\u2019s Slope tests). The magnitudes of trend in a Temperature time series have been estimated by Sen\u2019s estimator method. Auto correlation effect is reduced from the Temperature series before the application of the Mann\u2013Kendall test. On annual basis, the analysis of Mann\u2013Kendall test shows increasing (positive) non-significance trend in temperature time series over Upper Ganga Canal Command. Thus, in the study area, the temperature is increasing, which leads to the increment in evaporation, warmer days and nights in summer.

            "description": " In the thermal hydraulic experiments to determinate parameters of heat transfer, where fuel rod simulators are heated by electric current, the preservation of the simulators are essential when the heat flux goes to the critical point. One of the most important limits in the design of cooling water reactors is the condition that the heat transfer co-efficiently by boiling in the core to deteriorate itself. The heat flux just before deterioration is denominated as critical heat flux (CHF). At this time the small increase in the heat flux or in the inlet temperature of the cooler in the core, or the small decrease in the inlet flux of cooling, results in changes in the heat transfer mechanism. This causes increases in the surface temperature of the fuel elements leading to failures at the fuel (burnout). This paper describes the experiments conducted to detection of critical heat flux in nuclear fuel element simulators carried out in the thermal-hydraulic laboratory of Nuclear Technology Development Centre (CDTN). It is concluded that the use of displacement transducer is the most efficient technique for detecting critical heat flux in nuclear simulators heated by electric current in open pool.

            "description": " Numerical simulation was carried out to study the turbulent mixing behaviour of two opposite flows inside a square chimney model of a pool type research reactor. This type of chimney structure is often used for open pool type reactors to prevent mixing of core outlet water directly into the pool. The chimney design facilitates guiding of the radioactive water from the reactor core towards the side outlet nozzles and simultaneously allows drawing water from the reactor pool through the chimney top opening. This helps to limit the radioactivity level at the pool top to a lower limit. The present work aims at studying the turbulent mixing inside a 2/9th scaled down model of chimney structure. The Reynolds numbers considered in the simulation are 1.36\u00d7106, 1.81\u00d7106, 2.26\u00d7106 and 2.72\u00d7106 which correspond to upward core flow of 12.5, 16.67, 20.83 and 25 kg/s respectively. The core bypass flow which is sucked in the downward direction varies to 0, 5, 10 and 15% of the core flow. The effects of flow ratio between the upward flow and downward flow on the mixing behaviour are analysed using PHOENICS code. Turbulence is modelled by using the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation. The results indicate that increase in downward flow causes the jet height to decrease. It is observed that the jet height mainly depends on the ratio of core bypass flow and core flow. The effect of change on core flow is insignificant.

For the assessment on freshness of seafoods, so far, sensory, microbiological\u3000and biochemical methods are used. However, these are not appropriate method for large quantities. In this case, optical methods have advantages of quickness and nondestruction. In this review, biochemical changes during storage are described as a theoretical basis of the freshness evaluation and several current topics on optical noninvasive methods are introduced. Fluorescence of NADH has been applied to scallop adductor muscle, which showed that transient increase in fluorescence intensity was followed by the decrease until 2days of observation . Based on absorption spectra of squid hemocyanin, the oxygen dissociation curve shifted to the left during storage,which suggested that the affinity of oxygen depends on freshness. As for the transparency of squid mantle, new technology with transmittance permitted to analyze the changes to turbid state. The results were almost consistent with that obtained from the sensory test. The range applied to these new methods is still narrow but many results obtained would be reported in the near future.

Infrared spectroscopy allowed the observation of phosphoric acid and fluorosilicates absorption bands as well as the determination of the P/S ratio. X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the presence of impurities of HPO42- (crystallized in ardealite and brushite phases) and SiF62- (crystallized in malladrite phase) in phosphogypsum samples. A shaped-needles phase observed only in old sample micrographs corresponded to the brushite phase. Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis showed the influence of impurities on the thermal behavior of dehydrated calcium sulfate. Elemental analysis was provided with respect to scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray technique, X-ray fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and selective electrode analysis. Optical properties investigated by photoluminescence measurements allowed not only the identification of the matrix emissions but also the observation of Cd2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ impurities showing thus their presence in the studied phosphogypsum samples.\r\n ( Studies in Chemical Process Technology (SCPT) is an open-access and peer-reviewed journal.

We do not only annotate the\r\nphrases which immediately contain words that are marked up as polar.\r\nAny dependent subphrase (NP/PP) is integrated into all its dominating\r\nNPs/PPs, e.g. \"[Die tieferen Ursachen [der Faszination+]]\". Dependent\r\nsubphrases without any polar words are also included, however, there\r\nis no internal bracketing for them, e.g. \"[hohe+ Anspr\u00fcche an Qualit\u00e4t\r\nund Lage]\"\r\n\r\nAt the level of phrases, we distinguish the following markers:\r\npositive (+), negative (-), neutral(0), bipolar (#). The category\r\n'bipolar' is used mainly for coordinations where negative and positive\r\nsentiments of something are kept in balance by the writer. This is\r\nquite common for a lot of binomial constructions as \"Krieg und\r\nFrieden\". ) ",

Using project documents, gathered from in-country donor offices during three missions to Lilongwe, the AidData and CCAPS teams added standardized geocodes using the UCDP/AidData methodology. In total, projects from 30 donor agencies were geocoded for 548 projects, representing $5.3 billion in total commitments (approximately 80% of the total external assistance to Malawi reported to the government from 2000-2011). It represents the first effort to sub-nationally geocode all donors in a single partner country, and the first initiative of the sort envisioned by the Open Aid Partnership, an initiative spearheaded by the World Bank to increase the openness and effectiveness of development assistance at the subnational level. An interactive map displaying these data along with data on armed conflict, governance, and climate security vulnerability can be viewed at www.strausscenter.org/ccaps/mappingtool.
