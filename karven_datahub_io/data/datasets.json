            "description": "<div>Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV), one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the Western US, has seen a rebound in their business, which was hurt hard during the recession because of the regions the company serves, specifically California. Margins troughed for the company in the low 4% range, but have started to turn around, and should return back to the company's historic 6-8% range. This margin expansion creates a minimum 40% upside in the stock going forward. Margin expansion is further supported by a new store concept, favorable lease negotiations, and higher-end (higher-margin) products. BGFV will also enter the e-commerce area in 2014.The company has a &quot;margin of safety&quot; in the fact that even without margin expansion, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples, due in part to an over-blown, recent sell-off after the company's latest quarterly call. As we will talk about later in this article, BGFV's differentiated business model and regional focus also insulates the company from competition.Differentiated Store BaseOne thing that really interests me about BGFV is the location of the store base - the company focuses on the west coast. Here's a breakdown of the current store base by state:(click to enlarge)We see that over 50% of the store base is located in California. Because of this, the company was hurt pretty hard during the recession, but we have seen a strong rebound in CA, which provides more upside for BGFV going forward.Also, this west coast focus creates isolation against competition. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) has only 26 stores (5% of total store base) in California. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) has no presence (see below) in California, and Modell's is only located in the Northeast US. BGFV lists these companies as its major competition!Source: HIBB PresentationThe company has big upside from its presence in CA, and is isolated from competition because of the regions it focuses on.Differentiated store sizeAnother point of differentiation for BGFV is its store size. With an average size of 11,000 square feet, the stores are bigger than an average HIBB unit (5,000 square feet), but much smaller than the DKS concept (50,000 square feet). After following the sporting goods space for several years, my opinion is that this middle-size is perfect - big enough to be off-mall and carry more sporting equipment, but not as big as DKS (there has been some contention over the last year as to the viability of DKS growing to 900 stores if they plan of keeping the store size this big).New store concepts will be smaller, but still fit inside this mid-size concept.New Store ConceptsThe company has been testing a new, smaller store concept. The units have a lower upfront investment ($900K) and have average cash-on-cash returns of 24%. The New concepts also have higher margins (average operating margins of 12%) than the overall store base, which provides further support to the margin expansion story.E-Commerce LaunchSurprisingly, the company has no e-commerce platform as of today. Currently, you can only visit the BGFV website and find the closest store to purchase the item you are looking for.The company has been investing an e-commerce platform, which will launch in 2014. This should be another lever for growth for the company.Recent Sell-off - Q2 EarningsSo far we have a differentiated business model that faces only a small amount of competition from the other major sporting goods retailers. We also have a very interesting margin expansion story. Now, all we need is a good entry price. Lucky for us, we recently received this entry point after a sell-off due to the company's latest earnings call.The stock was sold off on the call for two major reasons, which I highlight below (along with my reason why the concerns were overblown):The company had been repurchasing shares, but stopped in the latest quarter. Also, when asked, the<b>air max 87</b> company guided for flat share count for the rest of the year. (The company has been aggressively paying down debt, and I took the comment for the rest of the year as conservative, as many company tell analysts to model flat share count when they in fact plan on repurchasing shares)Guidance is for the smallest margin increase the company has had in some time (they are comping against the strongest 3rd quarter in the company's history as a public company)I was actually quite impressed by the quarter. Highlights of the call included:Promotional activity decreased in the quarter (this is really good news compared to most of the retail industry)There has been a strong start to Q3Slight improvements in customer traffic and a mid-single-digit increase in average ticketSame-store sales improved for each of the major product category (apparel, footwear and hardgoods)So now we have a strong business model and good entry point. Let's get into detail about the most compelling part of the story - margin expansion.Operating Margins - An Opportunity for Mean ReversionOver the past two years, the company's operating margins have fallen into mid 4% range. Over the longer-term, the company's margins have usually fallen in the 6-8% range. Management believes that margins will return to the historical range based on the following:New store concepts have 12% operating marginsSales leverage as the California/west coast rebound continuesIncreasing merchandise margins - there has been a focus to sell higher-end, higher margins products. This push to higher-end products also further insulates the company against competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) (BGFV's 10-K lists the big box retailers as competition)Favorable real estate costs - management noted that as leases have come up for renewal, they have been able to get more favorable terms (specifically in California).Company is closing underperforming storesE-commerce platform spend goes away next year - the company stated that investment in the e-commerce platform will equal $.05 to $.06 of lower EPS in 2013 because of the increased SG&amp;AWhat's more, if you look at the trailing twelve months of performance, margins have returned to the low end (6.4%) of the range already (even though they are only in the 4.8% range for the last six months).OutlookThe company will do about $1B of revenue on average over the next two years (estimates are for just over $1B with a small range of $1.03-1.09B by seven analysts). Let's take a look at projections assuming no revenue growth and using the 6-8% operating margin range:  LowHigh Revenue ($'000s)$1,000$1,000 Operating Profit$60$80 Net Income$1.57$2.10     Free Cash Flow$36MM$48MM FCF Yield9.5%12.7%     EBITDA$82MM$102MM EV/EBITDA5.1x4.1xNote: Capex is at abnormally high levels in 2013 as the company invests in the e-commerce platform and distribution center. 2014 will see a reduction, which will increase free cash flow and allow for more dividends/share repurchases/debt paydowns.We can see as margins return to their normal levels, the stock becomes very cheap. Since the company will grow stores by 6% this year, the launch of the e-commerce platform in 2014, and the fact that there should be some upside in revenue as the west coast rebounds, these estimates could end up being conservative.A look at the competition's operating margins (DKS around 8% and HIBB around 12%) provides further support to management's 6-8% target.Balance SheetThe company has been aggressively using its free cash flow to<span style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.google.com.hk/intl/zh-TW/options/\">\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd</a></span><span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000456.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/identify-fake-gucci-sunglasses-104001366.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> pay down debt, from $77MM last year to $44MM today. This brings up a strong point - even though the company was at trough margins, it was still producing positive free cash flow.The company has also been using excess free cash to repurchase shares (the decline in purchases was part of the sell-off in the latest quarter). The company also has $6MM in cash and a revolver to fund operations.The company pays a dividend of $.10/quarter (2.4% yield). I expect this dividend to increase to about $.12/quarter next year.ValuationWe have seen what earnings could look like as margins return to normal levels, now let's take a look at the current valuation of BGFV compared to its competition:  P/EEV/EBITDAEV/Sales DKS15.0x9.0x1.0x BGFV11.0x9.0x0.5x HIBB15.5x10.0x1.5xWe see that even though BGFV is currently operating below normal margins, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples. Is this justified? Maybe during the recession, considering the markets BGFV serves, but we have seen a rebound in BGFV's regions (specifically in California) and see a path to margin expansion and EBITDA growth. I would expect that the multiples expand in the near-term, closer to the competitions' multiples. Using an average of 0.75x sales and 14.0x earnings, we get a price target of $24 (about a 40% premium to the current price). I believe these multiples are fair because the company should trade at a discount to its competitors, considering the aggressive growth expansion of the other two names.If we use the high and low end of the future outlook range (see outlook section above), assuming minimal revenue growth and margin expansion to normal ranges, we get a price target range of $24-$30 (40-75% upside - note this valuation range is based on a blend valuation of free cash flow (8% yield), EV/EBITDA (8.0x), and EPS (14.0x)).RisksRisks for the company include:Inability to continue improvement in marginsSensitivity to California economyPoor weather can have a large impact on salesCatalystsCatalysts for the company include:Increased sell-side coverage - on the latest quarterly call, there were only three sell-side analysts (and two buy-side analysts) on the call. Increased coverage could increase demand for the stockFurther margin expansion to the 6-8% target rangeStore expansion - the company will open 15 new stores this yearStrong results at new store conceptsStrong results from remodelsIncreased sales from a continued west coast reboundIncreased sales from the company's entry into e-commerceConclusionAfter a recent, overblown sell-off, investors have been given the opportunity to buy BGFV at a steep discount to its competition. The margin-expansion story has already begun, and will be further supported by new store concepts, higher margin projects, and a rebound in California. The company is isolated from major competition by its focus on the west coast, and should see revenue growth as it launches an e-commerce platform. I believe there is a minimum 40% upside in the name from its current price, and am encouraging investors to buy the stock with an intermediate-term target of $24, and a longer-term target of $30.</br>Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Since the company will grow stores by 6% this year, the launch of the e-commerce platform in 2014, and the fact that there should be some upside in revenue as the west coast rebounds, these estimates could end up being conservative.A look at the competition's operating margins (DKS around 8% and HIBB around 12%) provides further support to management's 6-8% target.Balance SheetThe company has been aggressively using its free cash flow to<span style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.google.com.hk/intl/zh-TW/options/\">\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd</a></span><span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000456.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/identify-fake-gucci-sunglasses-104001366.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> pay down debt, from $77MM last year to $44MM today. This brings up a strong point - even though the company was at trough margins, it was still producing positive free cash flow.The company has also been using excess free cash to repurchase shares (the decline in purchases was part of the sell-off in the latest quarter). The company also has $6MM in cash and a revolver to fund operations.The company pays a dividend of $.10/quarter (2.4% yield). I expect this dividend to increase to about $.12/quarter next year.ValuationWe have seen what earnings could look like as margins return to normal levels, now let's take a look at the current valuation of BGFV compared to its competition:  P/EEV/EBITDAEV/Sales DKS15.0x9.0x1.0x BGFV11.0x9.0x0.5x HIBB15.5x10.0x1.5xWe see that even though BGFV is currently operating below normal margins, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples. Is this justified? Maybe during the recession, considering the markets BGFV serves, but we have seen a rebound in BGFV's regions (specifically in California) and see a path to margin expansion and EBITDA growth. I would expect that the multiples expand in the near-term, closer to the competitions' multiples. Using an average of 0.75x sales and 14.0x earnings, we get a price target of $24 (about a 40% premium to the current price). I believe these multiples are fair because the company should trade at a discount to its competitors, considering the aggressive growth expansion of the other two names.If we use the high and low end of the future outlook range (see outlook section above), assuming minimal revenue growth and margin expansion to normal ranges, we get a price target range of $24-$30 (40-75% upside - note this valuation range is based on a blend valuation of free cash flow (8% yield), EV/EBITDA (8.0x), and EPS (14.0x)).RisksRisks for the company include:Inability to continue improvement in marginsSensitivity to California economyPoor weather can have a large impact on salesCatalystsCatalysts for the company include:Increased sell-side coverage - on the latest quarterly call, there were only three sell-side analysts (and two buy-side analysts) on the call. Increased coverage could increase demand for the stockFurther margin expansion to the 6-8% target rangeStore expansion - the company will open 15 new stores this yearStrong results at new store conceptsStrong results from remodelsIncreased sales from a continued west coast reboundIncreased sales from the company's entry into e-commerceConclusionAfter a recent, overblown sell-off, investors have been given the opportunity to buy BGFV at a steep discount to its competition. The margin-expansion story has already begun, and will be further supported by new store concepts, higher margin projects, and a rebound in California. The company is isolated from major competition by its focus on the west coast, and should see revenue growth as it launches an e-commerce platform. I believe there is a minimum 40% upside in the name from its current price, and am encouraging investors to buy the stock with an intermediate-term target of $24, and a longer-term target of $30.</br>Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Margins troughed for the company in the low 4% range, but have started to turn around, and should return back to the company's historic 6-8% range. This margin expansion creates a minimum 40% upside in the stock going forward. Margin expansion is further supported by a new store concept, favorable lease negotiations, and higher-end (higher-margin) products. BGFV will also enter the e-commerce area in 2014.The company has a &quot;margin of safety&quot; in the fact that even without margin expansion, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples, due in part to an over-blown, recent sell-off after the company's latest quarterly call. As we will talk about later in this article, BGFV's differentiated business model and regional focus also insulates the company from competition.Differentiated Store BaseOne thing that really interests me about BGFV is the location of the store base - the company focuses on the west coast. Here's a breakdown of the current store base by state:(click to enlarge)We see that over 50% of the store base is located in California. Because of this, the company was hurt pretty hard during the recession, but we have seen a strong rebound in CA, which provides more upside for BGFV going forward.Also, this west coast focus creates isolation against competition. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) has only 26 stores (5% of total store base) in California. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) has no presence (see below) in California, and Modell's is only located in the Northeast US. BGFV lists these companies as its major competition!Source: HIBB PresentationThe company has big upside from its presence in CA, and is isolated from competition because of the regions it focuses on.Differentiated store sizeAnother point of differentiation for BGFV is its store size. With an average size of 11,000 square feet, the stores are bigger than an average HIBB unit (5,000 square feet), but much smaller than the DKS concept (50,000 square feet). After following the sporting goods space for several years, my opinion is that this middle-size is perfect - big enough to be off-mall and carry more sporting equipment, but not as big as DKS (there has been some contention over the last year as to the viability of DKS growing to 900 stores if they plan of keeping the store size this big).New store concepts will be smaller, but still fit inside this mid-size concept.New Store ConceptsThe company has been testing a new, smaller store concept. The units have a lower upfront investment ($900K) and have average cash-on-cash returns of 24%. The New concepts also have higher margins (average operating margins of 12%) than the overall store base, which provides further support to the margin expansion story.E-Commerce LaunchSurprisingly, the company has no e-commerce platform as of today. Currently, you can only visit the BGFV website and find the closest store to purchase the item you are looking for.The company has been investing an e-commerce platform, which will launch in 2014. This should be another lever for growth for the company.Recent Sell-off - Q2 EarningsSo far we have a differentiated business model that faces only a small amount of competition from the other major sporting goods retailers. We also have a very interesting margin expansion story. Now, all we need is a good entry price. Lucky for us, we recently received this entry point after a sell-off due to the company's latest earnings call.The stock was sold off on the call for two major reasons, which I highlight below (along with my reason why the concerns were overblown):The company had been repurchasing shares, but stopped in the latest quarter. Also, when asked, the<b>air max 87</b> company guided for flat share count for the rest of the year. (The company has been aggressively paying down debt, and I took the comment for the rest of the year as conservative, as many company tell analysts to model flat share count when they in fact plan on repurchasing shares)Guidance is for the smallest margin increase the company has had in some time (they are comping against the strongest 3rd quarter in the company's history as a public company)I was actually quite impressed by the quarter. Highlights of the call included:Promotional activity decreased in the quarter (this is really good news compared to most of the retail industry)There has been a strong start to Q3Slight improvements in customer traffic and a mid-single-digit increase in average ticketSame-store sales improved for each of the major product category (apparel, footwear and hardgoods)So now we have a strong business model and good entry point. Let's get into detail about the most compelling part of the story - margin expansion.Operating Margins - An Opportunity for Mean ReversionOver the past two years, the company's operating margins have fallen into mid 4% range. Over the longer-term, the company's margins have usually fallen in the 6-8% range. Management believes that margins will return to the historical range based on the following:New store concepts have 12% operating marginsSales leverage as the California/west coast rebound continuesIncreasing merchandise margins - there has been a focus to sell higher-end, higher margins products. This push to higher-end products also further insulates the company against competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) (BGFV's 10-K lists the big box retailers as competition)Favorable real estate costs - management noted that as leases have come up for renewal, they have been able to get more favorable terms (specifically in California).Company is closing underperforming storesE-commerce platform spend goes away next year - the company stated that investment in the e-commerce platform will equal $.05 to $.06 of lower EPS in 2013 because of the increased SG&amp;AWhat's more, if you look at the trailing twelve months of performance, margins have returned to the low end (6.4%) of the range already (even though they are only in the 4.8% range for the last six months).OutlookThe company will do about $1B of revenue on average over the next two years (estimates are for just over $1B with a small range of $1.03-1.09B by seven analysts).

Although this drug will not kill all in the adult worms, it will avoid infected folks coming from giving the condition to a person else.<br>\r<br>Lymphedema and elephantiasis aren't indications with regard to DEC treatment method since the vast majority of people with lymphedema aren't actively infected using the filarial parasite.

Institutions of Higher Education, however, have different IT requirements. These differences are determined partly by the type of hardware and software that they use. At a time when business entities are striving to minimize costs without compromising the quality of services rendered, the choice as to what software to acquire must reflect considerations such as costs, infrastructure, equipment, management, accessibility and modernity. These are the advantages that are borne with the acquisition of a VMware View, used for the creation of a virtual desktop. The School of Law at the University of the Witwatersrand is the first School within the university to use VMware; and among the first within the Southern African region. Just as recently introduced, its impact is already being felt in different aspects \u2013 cost minimization, minimal utilization of space, efficacy, etc. Personal experiences, informal conversations with other users within and outside the university community, dictate to us the unbeatable advantages and benefits of using VMware.

            "description": "In this paper, we consider the problem of Multiuser Detection (MUD) in Direct Sequence/Code Division Multiple Access (DS/CDMA) communication systems. The optimum detector for MUD is the Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, but its complexity is very high and involves an exhaustive search to reach the best fitness of the transmitted and received data. Thus, there has been considerable interest in suboptimal multiuser detectors with less complexity and reasonable performance. If we look to the problem from an optimization viewpoint, what makes our work difficult is high interaction and Epistasis among variables which should be optimized. We propose to work on the problem and try to reduce its complexity instead of using more complex and powerful optimization algorithms. To do so, we analyze problem carefully and propose a new method to overcome Epistasis. In this paper, by using sign detector and longer code lengths in DS/CDMA system, a simple detector will be proposed. This method is compared with ML and two model-free optimization methods: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms which have been used for MUD in DS/CDMA. Simulation results show our method dramatic efficiency.\r\n ( International Journal of Communications (IJC) is an internationally refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in communications research.

            "description": "A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes which have the ability to communicate with each other without having fixed network infrastructure or any central base station. Individual nodes are responsible for dynamically discovering other nodes that they can directly communicate with. Communication between nodes may be achieved by means of Route Discovery and maintenance. Because of mobility nature, discovery task is more complex. A black hole is a malicious node that falsely replies to any route requests without having active route to specified destination and drops all the receiving packets. Black Hole Attack can be easily deployed by the adversary. If these malicious nodes work together as a group then the damage will be very serious. This type of attack is called cooperative black hole attack. A neighborhood based method to detect whether there exists a black hole attack and a routing recovery protocol to set up a correct path to the true destination. We propose a complete protocol to detect a chain of cooperating malicious nodes in an ad hoc network that disrupts transmission of data by feeding wrong routing information. In this model, the nodes authenticate each other by issuing security certificate with digital signature to all the other nodes in the network. This model is capable of detecting and removing black hole nodes in the MANET also with a secured route discovery by means of an algorithm termed as endairA algorithm.\r\n ( International Journal of Communications (IJC) is an internationally refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in communications research.

In this paper, it is shown that a cubic B-spline filter can be used to improve the non-linear image enhancement method. In the non-linear image enhancement, a higher-frequency component can be predicted to solve the blurred problem of an enlarged image. This paper also presents a new three-dimensional (3-D) down-scaling scheme to subsample video data for video coding. Furthermore, a novel non-linear image-enhancement compensation algorithm with cubic B-spline filter is presented to improve the prediction of higher-frequency component and accordingly the efficiency of the 3-D down-scaling video coding. Finally, a computer simulation shows that the proposed method yields a better quality of the decoded image than other non-linear enhancement methods.

Nevertheless, they are usually chosen due to their simplicity and not their performance as they are not always suitable compared to the human observer. In this work we present a Rate-Distortion approach to color image compression based on subband transforms using perceptual optimization of the compression quality. This approach is based on minimization of the Weighted Mean Square Error (WMSE) of the encoded image, which better corresponds to the quality assessment of the human eye. The WMSE can be measured in the YCbCr color space, for which visual weights are relatively easily derived. Based on the new approach, new optimized compression algorithms are introduced using the Discrete Cosine Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. We compare the new algorithms to presently available algorithms such as JPEG and JPEG2000. Our conclusion is that the new WMSE optimization approach outperforms presently available compression systems when a human observer is considered.\r\n ( International Journal of Communications (IJC) is an internationally refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in communications research.

In oil refining, in addition to the typical modified Claus plant feed, i.e. H2S and CO2, NH3, CS2, and COS are also often present or formed. These contaminants pose a risk of poisoning the catalyst beds, as well decreasing the overall sulfur recovery. In this paper, effect of reaction furnace and converter temperatures on performance of SRUs is described. Then, the common ways for adjusting these important parameters are presented for a typical sulfur recovery unit. The achieved results can be useful for designing the new Claus sulfur recovery units.

            "description": "Viscoelastic surfactants are very useful in various oilfield operations, such as enhancing oil recovery and hydraulic fracturing and acidification. Because of the permeability differences in the rock reservoir, a large part of the fluid injected can migrate to undesired regions. Therefore, viscous fluids are used to modify the permeability of certain regions of the rock formation. The products added to the fluids that provide this characteristic are called divergent agents. There are a large number of commercial products that can be used for this purpose, but the fluids prepared with them must have special properties. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these products in advance. This work examines the chemical structure and physic-chemical properties of commercial surfactants to identify those with potential application as divergent agents. To do this, the rheological behaviour of the commercial formulations was tested considering temperature and pH conditions typical of reservoirs.

Paraffin/polyurethane foams composite with flame retardant as thermal energy storage materials were prepared by absorbing paraffin in honeycomb structure of polyurethane rigid foams. These composites provide a new energy saving materials, which can be used for building heating/cooling systems, and the composites can also enhance the thermal comfort for residents. In the composites, paraffin was used as the phase change material (PCM), polyurethane (PU) rigid foams acting as the supporting material, or as nano-structured calcium carbonate (nano-CC) and red phosphorus (RP) acting as the flame retardant. The thermal properties, such as phase change temperature and latent heat, were investigated by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Chemical structure, micro-structure and flame retardant properties of paraffin/ polyurethane foams composite were determined by FT-IR, SEM and limited oxygen index (LOI) tester, respectively. The SEM results showed that paraffin was well dispersed in honeycomb structure of polyurethane rigid foams. The DSC results indicated that the composites melt at 80.3\u2103 with a latent heat of 25.8kJ/kg when the mass percentage of paraffin in the composites was 16.7%. The LOI results showed that nano-CC and RP decreased the flammability of the composites.

            "description": "Eccentric cementing status always occurs in the period of well completion in complex formation. Under this condition, buckling failure of casing has greater impact on normal production. According to adjacent balance criterion and higher differential equation, a determination method of buckling load for eccentric cementing casing was established. This avoids complex modeling and discretization processes when determining the critical buckling load of casing, and geometrical and physical parameters can directly be put in the formula of critical buckling load. There exists 8.3% relative error, comparing critical load from the formula with the result by using finite element method. That means the results are accurate. This method has the advantage of direct calculation and is easy for engineering applications without complex modeling and discretization processes.

The catalyst pellet used in this reactor was Co-Mo/Al2O3. At first, using the experimental data, a power law kinetic model was developed for hydrodesulphurization reaction. Then a pseudo-homogeneous two-dimensional dynamic model was proposed to describe the concentration profile in the reactor bed. The simulation obtained with the proposed dynamic model showed good agreement with experimental data and the sulfur concentration error in the reactor outlet was 3.8 percent compared to the experimental data. Two dimension modeling revealed that the radial variation of sulfur concentration is more in the reactor inlet than the outlet, but in general the concentration profile can be considered in one dimension. Unsteady reactor modeling showed that the transition time was higher in the reactor outlet and estimated to be 11667 seconds.

A five-level-four-factorial Central Composite Design (CCD) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the process variables for minimizing the FFA of JCO and maximizing the JCB (%) yield. The high FFA (14.6%) of JCO could be reduced to 0.34% by its pretreatment with methanol (6.5:1) using H2SO4 as catalyst (1.5% v/v) in 125 min time at 50oC temperature. A JCB yield of 98.3% was achieved with methanol/oil molar ratio (11:1) using NaOH as catalyst (1% w/w) in 110 min time at 55oC temperature. Second-order model equations were obtained to predict the FFA content and JCB yield as a function of input parameters. The models can be successfully adopted in fuel industry to reduce the FFA content of JCO and maximize the yield of methyl esters, thereby, improving the economy of the process.

In order to properly optimise production and monitor sand controlled well, it is imperative to evaluate the well performance, sand control effectiveness and durability of the treatment type installed in order to achieve the main aim of hydrocarbon production. The principal methods of sand control that are available to oil industry in Nigeria are internal gravel pack (IGP) and sand control using chemicals (SCON). This paper compares the principal methods of sand control measures installed in terms of their effect on performance, durability and sand control effectiveness in Niger Delta. Production and well data from 10 different wells were gotten for their flow rate, sand production and water production. Actual and ideal productivity index are calculated. Well inflow quality indicator (WIQI) was used as a criteria to determine the performance of the well for their treatment types. A graph of the production data was plotted against time (years). A bar chart of the treatment type before installation is plotted against time (years) and also a bar chart of sand produced after the treatment type installed was made to determine the durability and sand production effectiveness of the treatment types installed. The result show that SCON wells have better performance than IGP wells with WIQI values ranges from 0.6 \u2013 1 to that of 0.2 \u2013 0.6 for IGP wells. SCON wells recorded 2-4 years to that of 6 \u2013 12 years of IGP wells for durability. SCON wells recorded sand production of about 55Ib/1000bbl, to that of 34Ib/1000bbl, for IGP wells after their installations. Based on these findings IGP wells are recommended for Niger Delta formation.

Two microbial cultures, coded as NW O and CW O, showed an accelerated growth and higher CO2 production when molasses were used as carbon source. They were selected and identified by molecular-biology techniques as potential candidates to be used in future Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery studies. To improve CO2 production, a reformulated culture medium was evaluated using only the culture coded as NW O which showed the better growth. Results showed that the reformulated culture medium caused an increase in the production of CO2 from 1.64gL-1to 3.13 gL-1 by the NW O culture. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries allowed the identification of fermentative microorganisms; the NW O culture is composed of Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and Thermotoga neapolitana; the CW O culture is composed of Caldanaerobacter subterraneus.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

Brine composition includes salt concentration and type. Pink Desert limestone cores were used to conduct a series of coreflood experiments to address the effect of brine composition on the chemical reactions between carbonic acid and limestone rock. The experiments were designed to simulate the water alternating gas (WAG) injection of CO2 into saline carbonate aquifers. Supercritical CO2 and brines were injected at flow rates of 2 and 5 cm3/min at 70 and 200&amp;#176;F. Seawater, formation brine, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride brines were used in this study. A commercial compositional simulator was used to simulate the coreflood experiments at the lab conditions. The reaction rate constant of CO2 with calcite at different brine compositions was adjusted to match the calcium concentration obtained in the lab. Experimental data was used to predict the reaction rate constant between CO2/brine/rock and found to be increasing as the brine salinity increased (Log(k25)= -9.2) when CO2 dissolves in DI water, and -6.2 when CO2 dissolves in 5 wt% CaCl2 brine). A simulation study conducted on field scale showed that after 30 years of CO2 injection and 1400 years after injection stopped, brine composition does not affect the trapping mechanism of CO2 in the aquifer.

Considering the process of chemical adsorption in layers, it managed to show that when the fluid flows into the reservoir, even moderate magnitudes of over balance internal electromagnetic radiation occur. Under the influence of this radiation, certain order of direction and intensity oscillations of phonons is set. Regard to borehole maximum intensity, oscillations of phonons will take place in the zone of high tangential stresses. Therefore, at some depth from the borehole, wall rock will be destroyed into particles commensurable with clay. Behind the transition layer due to throw of electromagnetic energy into the reservoir and fluid, mass transfer from the periphery of the reservoir to an extended zone with stepwise increased porosity and high thermodynamic compressibility of fluid is formed. Inside this zone a strong and long-range interaction between particles of fluid is developing. Throw in of electromagnetic energy is a result of intensive electromagnetic radiation due to the inflow into the reservoir mud or kill fluid. This formation is called the associate. The associate emits electromagnetic waves that change over allogenic particles in porous medium beyond the associate in the excited state. Between associate and excited particle strong interaction set in, which manifested in attraction of particle to the associate, and it becomes a full member of the associate. Thus, there is a selective implication of allogenic fluid particles into the associate.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

It is observed that the cationic surfactants induced cooperative binding with the anionic polyelectrolyte at critical aggregation concentration (cac) and the cac values are considerably lower than the corresponding critical micelle concentration (cmc) for each of the surfactant irrespective of their hydrophobic tail size. The cmc of surfactants were observed at slightly higher surfactant concentration in polyelectrolyte solution than that in pure water. It was found that the surfactants with longer tail size strongly favour the interaction with NaCMC, indicating the dependence of aggregation phenomenon on the tail size of the surfactants.

Comparative performance cooling curve of a number of vegetable oil basestocks commercially available in Brazil was reported previously. These basestocks included: soybean, canola, corn, cottonseed and sunflower oils. However, these particular vegetable oils exhibit very poor thermal-oxidative stability, relative to petroleum oil, which is attributable to their molecular composition. To address this specific deficiency which affects long-term performance, a number of additional vegetable oils with much more favorable molecular structure were examined including: peanuit (groundnut) oil and coconut oil. To assess the quenching performance compared to conventional and accelerated quenching oils, cooling curve performance according to ASTM D6200 for two bath temperatures (60 &#176;C and 90 &#176;C) was determined. In addition, effective heat transfer coefficients were calculated and compared. It is noteworthy that the vegetable oils evaluated did not exhibit classical film boiling or nucleate boiling behavior during quenching.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

Data were gathered during a period of four months in two horizontal well of an oil field with the aim of assessing the relationship between Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and drilling efficiency trough the analysis of the most significant drilling parameters. There are several models and measurement systems available for measuring such parameters, however in many practical cases the possible maximum performances are not achieved and this suggests the idea that there is still room, from a research point of view, to increase acquisition accuracy and their correct evaluation. In this study, down hole data were acquired to calculate significant parameters for assessing drilling performances which can contribute to the avoidance of errors in torque calculation due to the effect of drill string friction and the consequent distortion of MSE curve. Moreover, the same data implemented in a model for Rate of Penetration (ROP) calculation and a map correlating RPM and Weight on Bit (WOB) values with Rate of Penetration was drawn.

The membranes were made via solution casting on water surface (as non solvent). After studying the effects of different parameters on the membranes morphology, it was found that the mixture of (1 n-butanol/ 3 iso-propyl alcohol), temperature range from 70-800C and polymer concentration range from 4-7 wt could be used to obtain uniform membranes. PV separation of ETB/water mixtures was carried out using these membranes. The results showed that with increasing ETB concentration, both total permeation flux and ETB separation factor increase. Increasing temperature, in the studied limited range, resulted in decreasing separation factor and increasing permeation flux. With decreasing permeate pressure, permeation flux increased and separation factor decreased. Overall mass transfer coefficient was evaluated using steady state ETB permeation flux equation. Membrane mass transfer coefficient, boundary layer thickness and liquid boundary layer mass transfer coefficient were calculated using the modified concentration polarization equation and the resistance in series model. Concentration polarization index (using membrane and liquid boundary layer mass transfer coefficients) was defined and used to present extent of the concentration polarization phenomenon. The modified Arrhenius model was used to correlate ETB permeation flux and the operating temperature. Good agreement was observed between the experimental results and the model predictions. Results showed that the effect of temperature on sorption is greater than that on diffusion.\r\n ( Journal of Petroleum Science Research (JPSR) is an international open-access and refereed journal dedicated to publishing the latest advancements in petroleum science.

Changes of the relative permeability curves before and after injecting surfactants with different interfacial tensions were contrasted. The relative permeability curves of water flooding had the following characteristics: relatively narrower two-phase region, lower water relative permeability at residual oil saturation, higher residual oil saturation(37.6%, 39.7% and 40.5%, respectively), and lower ultimate oil recovery(only 37.3%, 27.8% and 23.6%, respectively). While oil/water interfacial tension decreased from 16mN/m to 7.1&#215;10-4mN/m, the two-phase region became wider, and residual oil saturation decreased. At the same time, water relative permeability at residual oil saturation increased, and ultimate oil recovery increased by 13.6%, 15.6% and 16.4% respectively. And the lower the interfacial tension is, the better the effect of enhancing oil recovery is. In general, surfactants have a great application prospect on the oil field development of low and extremely low permeability reservoir, and the oil-water interfacial tension should be reduced as far as possible.

Some statistical tests were used for confirmation of the accuracy, consistency and reproducibility of experimental results. Moreover, statistical model was utilized for investigation of the coke formation rate. To determine the yield distribution of main products a reaction network consists of 21 reactions together with the related kinetic reactions rates were developed. Based on the developed models and utilizing suitable optimization algorithm, the best operating conditions were determined. The results declared that at the 883.9\u00b0C as coil outlet temperature,0.62 as steam ratio and residence time equal to 0.3 sec the optima levels were obtained in which the yield of ethylene, propylene and butadienes were respectively equal to 28.73%,12.33% and 4.02%.

Recharge pits, made up of readily available materials, are a simple, cost effective and satisfactory method for recharging ground water storage where an impermeable layer does not allow natural charge of ground water. Recharge pits of rectangular shape (1.7 x 1.4m) with depth of 1.80 m were dug and constructed in series in a micro watershed of area 1.78 hectare in Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh, India. Experimental studies were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and results indicated that logarithmic equations were best fitted for determining the rate of ground water recharge in Eastern Nimar valley region. It was also observed that about 32.74% of runoff may be allowed for ground water recharge by adopting the method. The findings of the study may be adopted for planning and management of ground water by the different stakeholders in water scarce area or where ground water is becoming a scarce resource.

Assessment on water-bodies as well as escribing on its characteristics is the most crucial work to be done in India where land is being occupied at a very high rate. Satellite images are not clear all the time and will have shadow effects, which has to identified and distinguished. Water body image may appear similar to shades of huge buildings due to reflection and echoing. Few substantial research have been conducted to extract information about water bodies from several multi-resolution satellite images. This paper proposes a novel methodology based on texture and spectral information of the satellite images to extract water bodies.

            "description": "The objective of this research is to compare dry anaerobic digestion of cow dung for methane production with wet anaerobic digestion under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures in batch cultures for 63 days. The results showed that a specific methane yield of 0.333 and 0.345 LCH4/gVSr was obtained at 35oC in the fermentation systems for a dilute ratio of 1:1 and 1:0, with a VS removal of 50.01%, and 56.33%, a COD removal of 54.99%, and 61.35%, respectively. When the fermentation systems was performed under 55oC, the specific methane yield was increased to 0.351 and 0.374 LCH4/gVSr, with a VS removal of 53.43% and 60.52%, and a COD removal of 58.37% and 65.36%, respectively. Though addition of water could promote start-up process and biodegradability of the substrate to some extent, the methane yields in the dry anaerobic digestion process were found comparable to the conventional wet anaerobic digestion process. Furthermore, the volume of the reactor was increased twice in the wet fermentation process (7.68% TS) of cow dung compared to the dry fermentation (15.18% TS) at the same loading rate. It was suggested that dry methane fermentation process was superior in energy recovery, saving resources and engineering investment compared with wet fermentation process.

The water quality index was calculated using indicator parameters viz., pH, turbidity, temperature, nitrates, total phosphate, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total solids, faecal coliforms with respect to its different uses like residential and commercial, as well as indicator parameters, in addition, index value was compared with quality rating to examine the seasonal variation in groundwater quality. The water quality index was observed from 74.0 to 83.0 and 63.0 to 78.0 in pre and post monsoon season, respectively. Our finding indicates that 100 percent (70 samples) groundwater samples were of desirable quality in pre monsoon season but 30 percent (21 samples) of all showed the quality change from well to less fair in post monsoon season, this seasonal variation in water quality rating has indicated the deterioration of water quality in the study area, thus indicating a need of proper treatment before use.

            "description": "Climate change has affected the climatic parameter characteristics worldwide. Investigations have been carried out by climatologists to find a possible relation of climate change with anthropogenic behavior by studying trends in different climatic parameters. However, the changes are not the same for all regions especially in India due to localized intensity, thus it must be quantified locally to manage the natural resources. Temperature, one of the most important components of climatic parameter, has been widely measured as a starting point towards the apprehension of climate changes courses. The main purpose of this study is to observe the temporal variability of temperature for the period of 1901-2002 (102 years), to improve the hydrological status of Upper Ganga Canal Command located in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as to determine trend in annual mean and monthly Temperature time series using nonparametric methods (i.e. the Mann\u2013Kendall and Sen\u2019s Slope tests). The magnitudes of trend in a Temperature time series have been estimated by Sen\u2019s estimator method. Auto correlation effect is reduced from the Temperature series before the application of the Mann\u2013Kendall test. On annual basis, the analysis of Mann\u2013Kendall test shows increasing (positive) non-significance trend in temperature time series over Upper Ganga Canal Command. Thus, in the study area, the temperature is increasing, which leads to the increment in evaporation, warmer days and nights in summer.

Therefore, it is either objective or subjective.\r\nThe second dimension covers the semantic orientation of the sentence, i.e. its\r\npolarity. Thus, it is either positive, negative or neutral.\r\n\r\nIn the second layer, we model the contextually interpreted sentiments on the\r\nlevels of words and NP/PP phrases. That is, the annotation decisions\r\nare based on the meaning of the words in the context of the sentence.\r\n\r\nWord sentiment markers:\r\nThe sentiments on the level of individual words are expressed by\r\nsingle character markers added at the end of the words.\r\n\r\nA word might be positive (+), negative(-), neutral(empty), a shifter\r\n(~), an intensifier (^), or a diminisher (%).\r\n\r\nIf a word ends with a hyphen (e.g., \"auf beziehungs-_ bzw.\r\npartnerschaftliche Probleme-\", an underscore is added to the word in\r\norder to prevent missinterpretations of the hyphen as a negative\r\nmarker.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only words that are part of an NP/PP are marked with\r\nsentiment markers. Annotated words are nouns, adjectives, negation\r\nparticles, prepositions, adverbs.\r\n\r\nThe world level annotation was done by 3 persons individually. The\r\nindividual results were harmonized into a single reference annotation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhrase level markers:\r\n\r\nEach phrase is marked up textually by brackets, e.g. \"[auf\r\nbeziehungs-_ bzw. partnerschaftliche Probleme-]\". The type of a phrase\r\n(NP/PP) is not written to the brackets. We follow largely the\r\nannotation model of TIGER for structuring embedded NPs and PPs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the following limitations with regard to TIGER exist: (1)\r\nAdjectival phrases are not marked up (2) Relative or infinitival\r\nsentences are not included in NPs/PPs if they appear at the end of a\r\nphrase or if the are discontiguous. We do not only annotate the\r\nphrases which immediately contain words that are marked up as polar.\r\nAny dependent subphrase (NP/PP) is integrated into all its dominating\r\nNPs/PPs, e.g. \"[Die tieferen Ursachen [der Faszination+]]\". Dependent\r\nsubphrases without any polar words are also included, however, there\r\nis no internal bracketing for them, e.g. \"[hohe+ Anspr\u00fcche an Qualit\u00e4t\r\nund Lage]\"\r\n\r\nAt the level of phrases, we distinguish the following markers:\r\npositive (+), negative (-), neutral(0), bipolar (#). The category\r\n'bipolar' is used mainly for coordinations where negative and positive\r\nsentiments of something are kept in balance by the writer. This is\r\nquite common for a lot of binomial constructions as \"Krieg und\r\nFrieden\". ) ",

            "description": "The CWEEDS files are computer data sets of hourly weather conditions occurring\r\nat 145 Canadian locations for up to 48 years of record, starting as early as\r\n1953, and ending for most locations in 2001. The primary purpose of these files\r\nis to provide long term weather records for use in urban planning, siting and\r\ndesign of wind and solar renewable energy systems, and design of energy\r\nefficient buildings. The general nature of the files, however, results in their\r\nwidespread applicability to any sector which is weather-sensitive, such as\r\ntransportation, air quality, agriculture, forestry, tourism, structural design,\r\nor general interest.\r\n\r\nUsers will likely find most value in providing the files as input into other\r\nsoftware that processes the observational data in some way that provides more\r\nspecific information germane to the user's requirements. For example, the\r\ninformation in the CWEEDS files can be used as input to design software that\r\nsimulates building or solar energy system performance on an hourly basis. Other\r\npossibilities include the calculation of summary statistics regarding the wind\r\nenergy potential at a location, or finding the means, variability, extremes, or\r\nfrequency of other weather conditions or combination of conditions specifically\r\ntailored to suit an application.\r\n\r\nThere is virtually no limit to the variety of useful analyses that can be\r\nperformed with the data in the CWEEDS files. The user will, however, need to\r\nprovide the software which will perform any additional analyses. Importing the\r\ndata into a spreadsheet or data base program is a common way in which further\r\nanalysis may be performed.\r\n\r\nThe CWEEDS CD-ROMs and disk only include compressed, formatted files of\r\nobserved and estimated weather observations, utility software to uncompress and\r\ncopy the files from the CD-ROMs, and documentation to explain the development,\r\ncontent, and format of the files.\r\n\r\nMost of the 21 weather elements such as temperature and wind speed have been\r\nabstracted directly from the National Digital Climate Archives maintained by\r\nthe Atmospheric Environment Service (AES) of Environment Canada in Downsview,\r\nOntario. Nine of the weather elements relate to solar irradiance amounts and\r\nhave been estimated for each hour for those elements and locations for which\r\nobservations are not available.\r\n\r\nThe computer data sets are arranged so that one year of weather data for one\r\nlocation is contained in one file about one megabyte in size in the\r\nuncompressed, WYEC2 format described below. There are 48 files, for instance,\r\ntotalling over 48 megabytes disk space in WYEC2 format for the full 1953-2001\r\nCWEEDS period of record. In total, the full CWEEDS 4500 files comprise a little\r\nover 4.5 gigabytes. \r\n\r\nA second set of files, called CWEC (Canadian Weather year for Energy\r\nCalculation), has been provided for convenience for a limited number of the\r\nlocations. These files are described in Section 4.\r\n",

            "description": " In the thermal hydraulic experiments to determinate parameters of heat transfer, where fuel rod simulators are heated by electric current, the preservation of the simulators are essential when the heat flux goes to the critical point. One of the most important limits in the design of cooling water reactors is the condition that the heat transfer co-efficiently by boiling in the core to deteriorate itself. The heat flux just before deterioration is denominated as critical heat flux (CHF). At this time the small increase in the heat flux or in the inlet temperature of the cooler in the core, or the small decrease in the inlet flux of cooling, results in changes in the heat transfer mechanism. This causes increases in the surface temperature of the fuel elements leading to failures at the fuel (burnout). This paper describes the experiments conducted to detection of critical heat flux in nuclear fuel element simulators carried out in the thermal-hydraulic laboratory of Nuclear Technology Development Centre (CDTN). It is concluded that the use of displacement transducer is the most efficient technique for detecting critical heat flux in nuclear simulators heated by electric current in open pool.

            "description": " Numerical simulation was carried out to study the turbulent mixing behaviour of two opposite flows inside a square chimney model of a pool type research reactor. This type of chimney structure is often used for open pool type reactors to prevent mixing of core outlet water directly into the pool. The chimney design facilitates guiding of the radioactive water from the reactor core towards the side outlet nozzles and simultaneously allows drawing water from the reactor pool through the chimney top opening. This helps to limit the radioactivity level at the pool top to a lower limit. The present work aims at studying the turbulent mixing inside a 2/9th scaled down model of chimney structure. The Reynolds numbers considered in the simulation are 1.36\u00d7106, 1.81\u00d7106, 2.26\u00d7106 and 2.72\u00d7106 which correspond to upward core flow of 12.5, 16.67, 20.83 and 25 kg/s respectively. The core bypass flow which is sucked in the downward direction varies to 0, 5, 10 and 15% of the core flow. The effects of flow ratio between the upward flow and downward flow on the mixing behaviour are analysed using PHOENICS code. Turbulence is modelled by using the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation. The results indicate that increase in downward flow causes the jet height to decrease. It is observed that the jet height mainly depends on the ratio of core bypass flow and core flow. The effect of change on core flow is insignificant.

            "description": " Recently, the growing awareness on health accelerates the demand for seafoods worldwide. Freshness of seafoods tends to be prior requirement. For the assessment on freshness of seafoods, so far, sensory, microbiological\u3000and biochemical methods are used. However, these are not appropriate method for large quantities. In this case, optical methods have advantages of quickness and nondestruction. In this review, biochemical changes during storage are described as a theoretical basis of the freshness evaluation and several current topics on optical noninvasive methods are introduced. Fluorescence of NADH has been applied to scallop adductor muscle, which showed that transient increase in fluorescence intensity was followed by the decrease until 2days of observation . Based on absorption spectra of squid hemocyanin, the oxygen dissociation curve shifted to the left during storage,which suggested that the affinity of oxygen depends on freshness. As for the transparency of squid mantle, new technology with transmittance permitted to analyze the changes to turbid state. The results were almost consistent with that obtained from the sensory test. The range applied to these new methods is still narrow but many results obtained would be reported in the near future.

            "description": "Industrial wet phosphoric acid production in Tunisia has led to the accumulation of high amounts of waste phosphogypsum by-products which are stocked mainly in piles. This harmful waste has still caused much anxiety and problems for the living especially in Sfax region (South-East of Tunisia) where it is rejected. In this paper two samples of Tunisian phosphogypsum, differing in their age, were analyzed by different analytical methods in order to compare and study the effect of impurities presence on gypsum\u2019s properties. Infrared spectroscopy allowed the observation of phosphoric acid and fluorosilicates absorption bands as well as the determination of the P/S ratio. X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the presence of impurities of HPO42- (crystallized in ardealite and brushite phases) and SiF62- (crystallized in malladrite phase) in phosphogypsum samples. A shaped-needles phase observed only in old sample micrographs corresponded to the brushite phase. Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis showed the influence of impurities on the thermal behavior of dehydrated calcium sulfate. Elemental analysis was provided with respect to scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray technique, X-ray fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and selective electrode analysis. Optical properties investigated by photoluminescence measurements allowed not only the identification of the matrix emissions but also the observation of Cd2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ impurities showing thus their presence in the studied phosphogypsum samples.\r\n ( Studies in Chemical Process Technology (SCPT) is an open-access and peer-reviewed journal.

The objectives were to describe rural livelihoods, examine how conditions for farmers have changed over time, and assess the impact of agricultural reforms on rural households. The training of enumerators, field testing of the survey and final revision of the questionnaire took place in June-July 1998. The survey itself was carried out over the period August to November 1998. The households were selected using a two-stage stratified random sample procedure based on the 1997 Pre-Census of Agriculture. In each of the six departments, villages randomly selected, with the number of villages proportional to the volume of agricultural production, subject to a minimum of 10 villages per department. In total, 100 villages were selected. In each village, nine households were randomly selected using listed prepared for the pre-Census. Three alternative households were selected for each village in case one or more of the nine were unavailable. In a few villages, the number of interviewed households was eight or ten, resulting in a final sample size of 899 farm households. \r\n\r\nTopics addressed in the survey include household and land characteristics, crop production, main agricultural activities, use of fertilizers and other inputs, source of credit, sale and use of crops, storage, consumption, time allocation, and sources of income as well as community level data on transport structure, marketing of agricultural products, village groups, agricultural production, extension services, and formal/informal credit. \r\n\r\nThe survey was conducted in collaboration with Laboratoire d'Analyse R\u00e9gionale et d'Expertise Sociale, Cotonou, Republic of Benin (LARES). Funding for the survey was provided by Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaflitche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ).",

Using project documents, gathered from in-country donor offices during three missions to Lilongwe, the AidData and CCAPS teams added standardized geocodes using the UCDP/AidData methodology. In total, projects from 30 donor agencies were geocoded for 548 projects, representing $5.3 billion in total commitments (approximately 80% of the total external assistance to Malawi reported to the government from 2000-2011). It represents the first effort to sub-nationally geocode all donors in a single partner country, and the first initiative of the sort envisioned by the Open Aid Partnership, an initiative spearheaded by the World Bank to increase the openness and effectiveness of development assistance at the subnational level.

Such kernel should allow scientists from laboratories, universities, institutes, and corporations to work together for a common cause: find new drugs against tropical disieases such as Malaria or Tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nFrom http://tropicaldisease.org/kernel/methods/\r\n\"The TDI kernel is freely downloadable as public domain data. Options include direct downloads of individually requested targets, pre-defined sets for each of our ten target genomes, and user-defined batch downloads. Users receive the data with no restriction in accordance with the Science Commons protocol for implementing open access data[27] that was designed to embody normal academic attribution norms and facilitate tracking of work based on the kernel. We note that our predictions are public domain, but some of the drugs used in our predictions might be subject to patents.\"Drug discovery predictions",
