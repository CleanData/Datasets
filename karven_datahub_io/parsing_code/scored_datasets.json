        "notes": "While owning a chain of hotels can be  exceptionally lucrative, it can be difficult when  looking for a  reputable pool repair business that  provide the  items that keep our pools in proper working order. Many offer similar services but finding  trusted,  liable, and  credible pool repair  business can be a challenge. Visiting <a href=\"http://www.cmgpools.com/services/pool-heaters.html\">raypak pool heaters</a> certainly provides aids you might tell your brother. Since many pool cleaning businesses hire young, inexperienced  employees, I  absolutely had my share of miscommunications and  blunders. To prevent this from happening again, I began  browsing online to find  dependable reviews and testimonials to make it easy for me to  pick the right companies for my hotel chain.\nSince my company needed a pool pump, Northridge chains of my hotel needed to research great pool cleaning services. Identify further on our affiliated site - Click here: <a href=\"http://www.cmgpools.com/services/pool-heaters.html\">site</a>. Luckily, they were able to find a  remarkable company who  set up a new pool pump and even offered to provide pool repair, Northridge chains were overjoyed by the prospect and took it right away. While my Northridge chain is a highly respectable part of the  neighborhood, it does require a  great deal of repairs to make it as  attractive as it was when it first opened. Since they  provided to repair the pool we  chose to  spruce up the pool while updating the  other hotel.\nA  couple of months after we had our great experience at Northridge, we needed a new pool heater Calabasas chain was getting ready for  autumn where we offer  terrific pool  celebrations in our indoor pool. Over the summer the pool  heating unit had stopped working and we again turned to the Internet for help. Visit <a href=\"http://www.cmgpools.com/\">california pool service company</a> to compare the inner workings of this concept. This stately <a href=\"http://www.cmgpools.com/services.html\">site</a> wiki has assorted thrilling suggestions for when to study it. To our surprise the pool  business we used in Northridge also worked in Calabasas and provided us with a pool heater at a  sensible price. Needless to say we now have them do our pool repair Calabasas  requires, too. While there are fewer repairs  required  because Calabasas is a new addition to my hotel chain, it is important to keep up with repairs and updates.\n Unfortunately the necessary pool repair West Hills requirements were extensive. Our chain in the West Hills was a risk for me but I fell in love with the building. Since the pool at the West Hills chain was an in ground pool, there were many  splits and dents in the concrete. There was also a  great deal of  nicked paint within the tiling of the pool and if we were going to open the hotel, we  needed to get the pool up and running so it would not be such an eyesore when  visitors arrive. While it was out of their way, the pool service company we worked with for the other two chains offered a  terrific pool service that was closer. They replaced the pool pump West Hills  required  as well as  set up a pool  heating system that  could possibly use  all the time.\nI was so surprised by both companies'  remarkable service and how  ready they were to  deal with all the hotels in my chain. I  prepare to use both companies  for many years to come. By making sure you  consider testimonials by  various other  clients and being specific about what you  require, you  could  discover exactly what you need.",

        "notes": "Buying a microwave oven is very much like buying any major home appliance ? you don?t do it often. So before you go to the appliance store to get a microwave for your home, there are several factors to consider so that the unit you?ll buy will satisfy you and won?t make you regret your purchase. Make a list of these factors and bring it with you to the store. This will make you easily compare product features and will help you make an informed decision. \n\nAmong the things you must put into consideration are: \n\n? What you Cook\nIf you?re planning to use the microwave for light tasks such as melting, reheating and cooking popcorn, you can go for low-cost units since you don?t actually need to get models with advanced features. But if your microwave will be used to prepare the family?s entire meals, then you have to prepare good amount of money to pay for latest models with modern features. If you allow your kids to use microwave, you also have to consider ease of use as well as the unit?s safety features. \n\n? Size\nFor large families who use microwaves regularly, large units are advisable. While smaller models are also for general use, they are really not that great for cooking food like casseroles, poultry dishes, and many others. When deciding on the size of the oven, you should also think about the place in your house where you want to position it. If you?re going to place it on the kitchen countertop, compact or portable microwave ovens are ideal. \n\n? Power Consumption\nYou can cook faster on units with higher wattage. Most microwaves available in the market come with power rating ranging from 600 to 1200 watts. \n\n? Type of Microwave Unit\nThere are two main types of microwave oven ? the countertop and built-in microwaves. If there?s a place allotted for the microwave in your countertop, then go for standard countertop models. These units are way easy to use",

Identify further on this affiliated article directory by clicking <a href=\"http://www.ecigreview24.com/\">investigate best e-cigarettes 2011</a>. There anything concerning the vegetable made drink that breathes life in to them and wakes people up. Some tips can be found by you about how exactly to make this amazing beverage, from beans to grinds, in the following report. \n\nIf you enjoy tasting coffee, add your flavoring syrup directly to your hot coffee. Put the syrup after you put your coffee into your mug, then mix. Before the flavoring has been consumed don't add milk. This gives the coffee to battle the quality and increases the aroma and taste. \n\nDo not buy purchase coffee that has packaged beans and is pre-flavored. These coffees are created using gas that's difficult to clean out of a coffee pot. They'll also affect potential containers of coffee that you make, giving each subsequent cup an interesting taste. More over, the tastes these coffees are made with usually do not taste good anyway. \n\nBe sure that you often refrain from adding coffee beans in the freezer or ice box. When these beans are positioned in areas that contain food, it'll absorb the odors of the food and remove from the coffee flavor. This can destroy the grade of your coffee, as you need to always split up beans from other nourishments. <a href=\"http://www.ecigreview24.com/e-cigarette-brands/\">Website</a> contains further concerning why to mull over this concept. \n\nAvoid it, even when your coffee pot includes a \"pause and serves\" variety feature. Let the espresso brew completely before pouring your self a cup. When you use this feature, the coffee pot must let and wait the water temperature to the proper temperature before it may begin dripping again. \n\nKeep an eye on how much coffee you drink. Drinking coffee is a good way to get some energy and black coffee can help you keep your weight in order but drinking too much coffee can make you feel stressed and cause you to get a bad appearance. <a href=\"http://www.smokelessdiscounts.com/\">Inside Smokeless Cigarette Discounts</a> is a telling online library for more concerning the inner workings of this view. Avoid drinking a lot more than three glasses of coffee through your day. \n\nTo control the potency of your coffee, watch how big your work. In this case, coffee is like garlic. The smaller you cube (or work) it, the stronger the quality you'll receive when cooking or brewing. Then keep your mill relatively large, If you should be looking for a milder taste. \n\nIf you frequent a specific coffeehouse often, see if they will give you a discount for attracting your personal glass or pot. These cups can sometimes cost the shop several pennies at a time, so that they can cut costs also over time. They also get a pro-environmental statement to be made by the chance with you. \n\nTo lessen acidic coffee, grab that salt shaker. You need to use merely a pinch of salt in your coffee grounds when brewing to control the acidity of the coffee. Be mindful not to overdo it. Too much salt will obviously change the overall taste of the coffee. \n\nTake it off of the burner, if you brew a sizable pot of coffee that'll not be eaten quickly. Place it into a pre-heated storage device. Browse here at the link <a href=\"http://www.betterecigarettes.com/\">v2cigs review</a> to compare why to acknowledge this belief. The style may deteriorate quickly, when coffee is left on the burner. A pleasant carafe or other storage device can eliminate this issue. \n\nInstead of making iced coffee with the addition of ice to freshly brewed coffee, try different things. After making your coffee, let it warm to room temperature. Then take ice cube trays and put the coffee into the trays. Freeze, and you have frozen coffee cubes, if they are done. The coffee is kept by this from losing flavor. \n\nDon't hesitate to create your personal products. All that's necessary is different blends of coffee, an excellent coffee machine and different materials such as milk, product, syrups, nuts and fresh fruits.

The real go-getters will whip up a company card website proper away with their speak to information, about me information, and their prices and solutions provided.\n\nBut, then that website sits and collects dust while they wait for the traffic to roll in. So, whats a Virtual Assistant to do to generate targeted traffic to their site?\n\nOftentimes VAs overlook one particular of the best strategies of advertising their web sites  article writing. <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/kathleencalicda/boards/\">Needs</a> is a compelling online database for further concerning where to see about it. Virtual Assistants can create about all kinds of topics  how to organize emails, client service, hiring or firing a VA, techniques a VA can advantage a company, or accounting amongst other issues. Then, they can share the articles, just like any other internet site owner to drive visitors to their web sites and establish an expert status in their field.\n\nIf youre a VA whos new to report sharing, its really quite effortless. You create a valuable article and include your author bio at the end. (See the finish of this report as an example.) Then, you submit your article to Write-up Directories exactly where hungry website owners, weblog owners and ezine publishers eagerly grab your post to publish it on their internet sites.\n\nNow, there is stiff competitors so its not very that easy, but thats the gist of how post sharing works. And, you know it works since youre reading my post that Ive written and shared with post directories. Theres my URL in the author bio and youve located my write-up due to the fact a person has published it on their site, weblog or in their newsletter. If it works for me, it can work for you, also.\n\nArticle sharing is underutilized in the Virtual Assistant field and I hope to see that alter in the coming year. Go grab that free of charge traffic and grow your VA business. Not only will your VA organization develop, but you can share this technique of marketing and advertising with your clients and blow them away with your knowledge of web advertising. Best wishes.

This is a pity, since unless one understands the physiological as well as psychological basis of formal colour theory it's hard to understand why some photographs work and some don't, except on a \"gut feel\" basis.? Using strong colors in images produce an incredible effect allowing the image to speak to the viewer. We think and feel in color which makes it obvious that well utilized color will draw the eye of the viewer. Here are some keys to understanding and using color more effectively in your photos. Violet is a Second Order colour formed by the mixing of Blue and Red. It is not a colour which is readily found in nature, though of course the flower of that name is a notable exception. Violet is a colour traditionally associated with nobility and it conveys a feeling of elegance and warmth.\n\nEach time a new camera model is released the first improvement manufacturers like to talk about, is a better image processor. Olympus name their image processor Truepic, Sony name their's Boinx and Canon use the Digic processor. It is the function of these processors to record the measured white balance information that will be saved with the RAW image. It is also these processors that will rebuild the RAW image into a 8 bit JPEG color file. This color file is then saved on the memory card. For situations where the white balance presets won't do, most cameras also come with a Custom White Balance setting. In this mode you begin by taking a photo of a white object (a sheet of white paper or a professional white balance card) under the lighting conditions of your scene. Then you just tell your camera to use that image as its white balance reference, and then all photos taken under those conditions will come out correctly balanced.\n\nThank you for reading this blog post. I also want to recommend my <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/canon-g15'>Canon powershot g15</a> post to you. Please take a look, and I know you will like it! Enjoy your camera and the color you have captured.",

        "notes": "Many schools or universities require the study of the language. Before you start resenting the very idea of it, consider that it would be to your advantage for you to study and master a language. Make no mistake about it: the world doesn't speak English. For anybody who has travelled to anywhere but the very largest of the planets capitals, local people still primarily talk the local language and perhaps not English. To consult with them, the only method to do this will be to understand their language. \n\nHere are 5 reasons to why you need to study a foreign language: \n\n1.

If you are learning a less common language, imagine how much more useful you will be since there are fewer foreign speakers of it. \n\n2. Become an even more globally-viable businessperson: On earth of business, communication is king. It doesn't matter how well you can program a computer, do sales, or layout new products: if you can't talk to other people, you'll not get the success you deserve in the business world. Learning how to speak in a foreign language properly increases your value like a communicator. And, many individuals who become proficient in a foreign language find yourself really improving their abilities as a communicator inside their native language, too. Browse here at the link <a href=\"http://transactionlinguistics.com/learn-portuguese/\">your learn to speak portuguese</a> to research the purpose of this concept. Learning a language makes a much better communicator to you total, and it therefore makes you a far more beautiful employee o-r partner in the world of business. \n\n3. Expand your mind: Speaking a foreign language with fluency really suggests switching stations to a different thought process. Once you become fluent enough in-the foreign language you're learning, you'll find your awareness really growing to accommodate your new power. Each language has a unique set of terminology, words, and concepts that do not immediately translate to other languages. The result for multilingual people is that they actually force their nerves to grow and link in new ways. Successfully, you then become slightly more and wiser mentally flexible. \n\n4. Be attractive: Planning to impress your partner, wife, date, o-r that lovely person that you see whenever you shop? Becoming conversant in a language is a great way to create your-self up a notch around the attractiveness scale. People who expand their horizons are very nearly always perceived as more desirable than those who are always pleased with the same-old stuff, year after year. \n\n5. Understand the world better: The world is getting smaller. Individuals and leaders in different countries are making choices daily that affect many of us in economic, environmental, and political terms. <a href=\"http://transactionlinguistics.com/learn-spanish/\">Speak Spanish</a> contains supplementary information concerning the inner workings of this view. By studying a language, you provide yourself with the additional lens through which to see the ideas, actions, and worldviews of others. This will help you make more well-balanced decisions about how to do something o-r respond when you learn about world events. \n\nUnderstanding a language can be very difficult, but for each new term you memorize, for each new verb you learn to conjugate, you'll be making yourself more interesting, more financially viable, and a bit wiser and more desirable.Transaction Linguistics\n4115 Edwards Mountain Dr\nAustin, TX 78731\n512-420-8039",

        "notes": "## About\r\n\r\n> The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body. It is intended to be used for applications in metabolomics, clinical chemistry, biomarker discovery and general education. The database is designed to contain or link three kinds of data: 1) chemical data, 2) clinical data, and 3) molecular biology/biochemistry data. The database currently contains nearly 2500 metabolite entries including both water-soluble and lipid soluble metabolites as well as metabolites that would be regarded as either abundant (> 1 uM) or relatively rare (< 1 nM). Additionally, approximately 5500 protein (and DNA) sequences are linked to these metabolite entries. Each MetaboCard entry contains more than 90 data fields with half of the information being devoted to chemical/clinical data and the other half devoted to enzymatic or biochemical data.

        "notes": "Implied lines are also imaginary, as they are not necessarily physically apparent in a photo and most are created by our minds through the perceptions we hold in our consciousnesses.  As I?ve often said at my photography workshops, ?If it?s meant to be bent, bend it,? when discussing posing, and this is a great example of how our subconscious follows the body to create these lines.  Have your subject put her hands in her hair, shoot a horizontal image where the elbow joints are cropped out, but the limbs are still evident, and you?ll find that our minds will ignore, the missing limbs, and connect the visible parts. Inherent lines tend to statically exist, like trees (vertical line), doorframes, the edge of a wall, or the spirals of a staircase.  These lines come in various directions, such as vertical, horizontal or diagonal, though the strongest inherent lines in a photograph are more phallic, which is something taught in a basic art 101.  Use inherent lines to try and tell the story, often vertical inherent lines symbolized power and horizontal inherent lines symbolize a relaxed state. Instead of looking at composition as a set of ?rules? to follow - I view it as a set of ingredients that can be taken out of the pantry at any point and used to make a great ?meal? (photograph). Alternatively I?ve often described it as a set of ?tools? that can be taken out of one?s compositional tool belt at any given time in the construction of a great image.\n\nSo you need to think of different kinds of subject matter with similar patterns. What about the honeycomb of a bee hive shot at such an angle as to produce a sense of diminishing perspective? How about a long illuminated walkway between two buildings? There are plenty of patterned subjects when you stop to think about it. The world is yours for the taking. The world we perceive is not flat. We live in three dimensions. The same object, when placed far away from you, appears smaller. The world gets smaller and smaller the further it gets from you. This isn?t rocket science. It?s simply the way visual perception has to work if it is going to work at all.\n\nMy name is Sheila, I hope you like this short blog post!

        "notes": "Most people have heard of \"web hosting,\" but don't actually know what the service provides. Web hosting allows users the server resources that make it possible to create and run a website. If you want to learn how web hosting benefits you and your website, keep reading for solid advice about web hosting.<br /><br />Avoid web hosts that have a great deal of down time. Host sites that have a lot of outages and don't have any type of backup plan or prevention plans to keep this from happening are probably not a reliable company that you want to deal with. Constant outages show that they're unprofessional, so don't join one of these.<br /><br />Almost every web host has additional features available in their packages, although the exact add-ons may vary from host to host. When you're looking at all the options, be sure that what people are offering matches what you're looking for. For instance, one host can have a lower price advantage, but the feature you need may only be in a package that is higher priced.<br /><br />Create a list of your needs ranked by importance before you start your web host research. Determine your business goals and needs, so that you can look at each host and decide if they will be able to help you meet them. Making a list should help you make a good decision based on different factors instead of focusing on the price, only.<br /><br />Free is good, but a free web hosting provider isn't always the best choice. Free hosts pay for themselves in several ways, including adding banner ads and other distractions to your site. The ads will be wherever the host wants to put them, and you won't be able to control their content. Also, these random ads placed on your site give it an unprofessional look and feel.<br /><br />Your decision for a web host should not be based on the host being free. Such providers often display numerous ads on sites they host. You won't be able to choose which ads show on your site, or the types of advertising that will pop up.

It will not get more product on the brush, and will trap air inside the bottle. Once air is trapped inside a container, bacteria will start to breed at an increased rate. So, instead of pumping up and down, tilt the brush slightly, spinning it to make sure it's coated properly.<br /><br />Clean out your closet. Too much clothing can hamper your style. A closet that is packed full and is cluttered only limits you. Sift through everything and toss things you don't wear regularly, find flattering or that don't fit you well.

Discover further about <a href=\"http://advancedtissueservices.com/ffpe-dna/\">ffpe dna rna</a> by visiting our engaging essay. Generally speaking a regular freezer of either typ-e may hold 3-5 pounds of frozen food per cubic foot of useable space. Most freezers come between 5.5 cubic feet up-to 2-5 cubic feet. You will not need to purchase a freezer that's going to be too big to fill. This is a waste of space, and of the money. Your fridge can run better the fuller it's. \n\nThe next consideration would be the floor space you've in your house for the freezer itself. Than do straight freezers chest freezers need more floor space. Chest freezers are often more energy-efficient than vertical freezers. Chest freezers are generally better covered than upright freezers and free less cold air when exposed.

A chest fridge is likely to be better for snowy larger or bulky products. Chest freezers don't have shelves, they have bins for easy storage of frozen products. Chest freezer generally do not can be found in colors other than white for the simple fact they generally are kept in basements or garages. Chest freezers certainly are a wetter environment than straight freezers which does help avoid freezer burn up on meals. Chest freezers should be by hand defrosted. Another important element is a son or daughter safety lock, particularly having a chest freezer. \n\nVertical freezers are like a refrigerator/freezer. They will have one or two doors that open from the leading and from three to eight shelves for storage. An upright freezer will require much less floor space than the usual chest freezer. The shelves can make an upright freezer more straightforward to arrange than a chest freezer. You'll want to choose if you want a manual defrost or self defrost freezer. Information defrost vertical freezers are cheaper to buy than self defrosting freezers, but who really wants to have to defrost their fridge? \n\nYou may want to consider purchase of a fridge alarm. This can become a great investment, specially if you have an older freezer because it will alert you having an alarm if the temperature in your freezer drops which can give you time to save your valuable food.",

        "notes": "Cada vez es mas com\u00fan encotrar en casas particulares de todo el mundo, debido a la <a href=\"http://www.merkanimal.com>compra venta animales</a>, criaturas de las mas variadas especies de todo el planeta, no estamos hablando de venta de perros. Muchas veces, animales procedentes de compra ventas ilegales de personas que buscan alojamiento en lugares \u00e9xoticos por unos d\u00edas con el fin de traficar e importar a sus paises de origen estos lucrativos animales que les suponen y garantizan una riqueza economica muy suculenta que no quieren despreciar.Pero, \u00bfque podemos decir de la diferencia del habitat en que viven, al que una vez cautivos los llevan?.\r\n\r\nUna mirada cautelosa a la selva amaz\u00f3nica\r\n\r\nEL PEQUE\u00d1O reactor vuela sobre los Andes sudamericanos en direcci\u00f3n al este, rumbo a la vasta selva amaz\u00f3nica. Dejando atr\u00e1s los picos cubiertos de nieve, miramos por nuestra ventana. Debajo se extiende una vasta alfombra de color verde brumoso. Al examinar el paisaje m\u00e1s de cerca, se asemeja a una masa de florecillas de br\u00f3culi densamente api\u00f1adas. Como en un bordado, el \u201clazo\u201d de r\u00edos serpenteantes y el \u201cojete\u201d de verde m\u00e1s claro, formado por las puntas salientes de las palmeras, a\u00f1aden una agradable variedad a la escena. Pronto el avi\u00f3n comienza a descender. La alfombra verde se transforma ante nuestros ojos en una asombrosa variedad de \u00e1rboles que contrastan en tama\u00f1o y descripci\u00f3n.\r\n\r\nLa selva del Amazonas se conoce como la m\u00e1s rica zona de plantas del globo terr\u00e1queo. Se han identificado decenas de miles de variedades. En casi cada milla cuadrada (2,6 km2) crecen mucho m\u00e1s de cien clases de \u00e1rboles. Dependiendo de las diferencias geogr\u00e1ficas de altitud, hay espesuras de \u00e1rboles de mangle, \u00e9bano, caoba fina, cedros, arom\u00e1ticos palos de rosa, casta\u00f1os, altos palos del Brasil, varias clases de sauces y hermosos \u00e1rboles de caucho. Esparcidas entre todos \u00e9stos hay numerosas variedades de palmas y \u00e1rboles frutales tropicales. Las ramas rebosan de enredaderas y plantas trepadoras. Tan profusa es la verdura que las cimas de los \u00e1rboles pugnan por alcanzar un cielo apenas visible.\r\nAl nivel del suelo la colecci\u00f3n de vida vegetal sencillamente es espectacular. Hay una mezcla de hojas de formas ins\u00f3litas y hierbas de toda clase y variedad. Ce\u00f1idas al suelo hay una variedad interminable de plantas, en cuyo follaje se combinan el verde, rojo, rosado, p\u00farpura, amarillo y blanco. Otras plantas de poca altura sirven de cerco a hileras de espigas vigorosas del tipo de cacto y a palmeras bajas, arbustos y vegetaci\u00f3n de hojas grandes. Los helechos sedosos y sueltos a\u00f1aden un toque delicado de verde m\u00e1s p\u00e1lido. Las enredaderas se aferran a cualquier espacio sobrante.\r\nEn muchas zonas flores de intensos colores abrillantan la escena. Hay macizos de flores de colores rosados y rojos. Florecillas amarillas apenas asoman de entre ra\u00edces nudosas. De las ramas cuelgan racimos de flores de naranja brillante, carmes\u00ed intenso y blanco. Tambi\u00e9n hay magn\u00edficos despliegues de delicadas orqu\u00eddeas que anidan en los troncos de los \u00e1rboles o parecen caer en cascadas de las ramas. Ni una hoja se mece en el aire h\u00famedo.\r\nSe\u00f1ales de vida animal\r\n\r\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 hay de la vida animal? Las hormigas barrigonas que se llaman Tangarana enjambran en el \u00e1rbol palo de santo. A cambio de una morada permanente, estas hormigas protegen el \u00e1rbol del menor toque de cualquier invasor. Abajo, en el suelo de la selva, las hormigas cortadoras de hojas marchan en fila india, cada una cargando un pedazo grande de hoja. Innumerables escarabajos se precipitan aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1 o velozmente emprenden el vuelo. Especialmente se puede notar el mayor de todos los escarabajos, titanus giganteus, que mide unos 15 cent\u00edmetros de largo. De vez en cuando uno ve el destello de una luci\u00e9rnaga que se hace visible en la penumbra permanente de la densa maleza. Brillantes mariposas y gigantescas polillas de extra\u00f1a apariencia emprenden el vuelo. Cerca, las ranas croan. A nuestros pies, curiosas lagartijas verdes y grises salen cual flecha, mientras que peque\u00f1as salamandras suben velozmente a los \u00e1rboles.\r\nEn alguna parte de la selva hay anacondas gigantes\u2026 se afirma que las m\u00e1s grandes de estas serpientes miden hasta 12 metros de largo y casi un metro de di\u00e1metro. De las 250 clases de reptiles que se dice que moran en la selva del Amazonas, pocas verdaderamente son venenosas. A menos que se les sorprenda o se les moleste, las variedades rapaces solamente matan para obtener alimento, y el hombre no es parte de su r\u00e9gimen.\r\nContrario a la opini\u00f3n popular, no todos los animales que viven en la selva son animales grandes y peligrosos. En la selva sudamericana, el mayor animal es el tapir, que es del tama\u00f1o del cerdo, y le siguen de cerca el puma y el jaguar. Comparten la maleza tigrillos semejantes a gatos, y el oso hormiguero de largo hocico, armadillos y ocelotes. Las zorras, mapaches, peque\u00f1os ciervos y muchos tipos de roedores tienen su nicho en el suelo de la selva. En condiciones ordinarias no se sabe que ninguno de \u00e9stos sea una amenaza a los seres humanos. Se dice que de las 14.712 variedades de animales que habitan en la zona del Amazonas, m\u00e1s de 8.000 existen \u00fanicamente en esta regi\u00f3n.\r\n\r\nVida animal en los \u00e1rboles\r\n\r\nCon mucho la mayor concentraci\u00f3n de fauna vive en los \u00e1rboles. Los gritos y los roncos chillidos identifican mundos de loros, guacamayos, tucanes y numerosas otras clases de aves, algunas conocidas y otras poco conocidas. A\u00f1ada a esto el chirrido de los periquitos, los arrullos y gorjeos de las palomas, de las chotacabras americanas y de otros, as\u00ed como el ratat\u00e1 ruidoso del p\u00e1jaro carpintero, y usted empieza a percibir el afanoso mundo de las alturas. Varias clases de monos de cara curiosa y de libre movimiento se balancean f\u00e1cilmente de rama en rama, mientras parlotean y ri\u00f1en. Volando en c\u00edrculo sobre las cimas de los \u00e1rboles, hay buitres alertas que est\u00e1n a la espera de una comida. Sus apetitos voraces mantienen la zona limpia de carne putrefacta.\r\nAqu\u00ed y all\u00e1 hay estanques en los cuales las hojas gigantescas de las ninfeas esconden brillantes peces tropicales. Por todas partes hay peque\u00f1os arroyos de agua que las hojas han te\u00f1ido de color pardo. Al fin todo fluye al Amazonas, la carretera de la selva.\r\n\r\nVida en las aguas\r\n\r\nEn las aguas de la selva del Amazonas hay pastinacas, gimnotos, caimanes, tortugas y pira\u00f1as de dientes afilados que pueden despojar a un animal de su carne en tan solo unos pocos minutos de febril actividad. Uno tiene que indagar con los nativos de la localidad antes de nadar en cualquiera de estas aguas. \u00a1Las aguas de la selva no son necesariamente buenas piscinas de nataci\u00f3n! Sin embargo, uno ve peque\u00f1os grupos de ni\u00f1os nativos chapoteando en algunos de los lentos r\u00edos de la selva. Esto nos lleva a la gente que vive en la zona del \u201cgran r\u00edo,\u201d la cual contribuye de manera interesante al temperamento de la selva.\r\nSu gente\r\n\r\nHace tres o cuatro siglos por lo menos 230 diferentes tribus de indios habitaban la regi\u00f3n. Viv\u00edan en peque\u00f1as comunidades aisladas, y por lo general se limitaban a ciertas zonas geogr\u00e1ficas. Entre los dominios de tribus que todav\u00eda se reconocen hoy d\u00eda se encuentran los de los j\u00edvaros, aucas, campas, chamas, machiguengas y shipibos. Quiz\u00e1s solo queden unas veinte tribus bien definidas. No tienen muchas necesidades\u2026 tal vez una casa de troncos, una o dos hamacas, una cerbatana y una lanza. Su r\u00e9gimen consiste principalmente de yuca, bananas, tortugas y pescado.\r\nLa selva amaz\u00f3nica ciertamente es una zona fascinante\u2026 un lugar tranquilo. Este apacible y h\u00famedo ambiente de vez en cuando se ve perturbado por tronadas tropicales. Sin embargo, estos sonidos y los ex\u00f3ticos ruidos de una gran variedad de animales en realidad no perturban la calma de la inmensa y apacible selva. Aunque muchas clases de criaturas se albergan en ella, la selva no es un ambiente lleno de tremendos peligros para los que respetan las se\u00f1ales que dicen \u201cNo moleste.\u201d\r\n\r\nShare this:\r\n\r\n    Twitter\r\n    Facebook\r\n\r\nMe gusta:\r\nMe gusta\r\nSe el primero en decir que te gusta.\r\nBy nureciseo in Uncategorized on enero 6, 2013.\r\nDeja un comentario\r\n\u00daltimas Entradas\r\n\r\n    COMPRA VENTA ANIMALES EX\u00d3TICOS\r\n\r\n    Cada vez es mas com\u00fan encotrar en casas particulares de todo el mundo, debido a la compra venta animales, criaturas de las mas variadas especies\u2026\r\n\r\n",

        "notes": "Having your kids in extra curricular activities helps them turn into a well-rounded individual. Apart from baseball or boxing, another activity you can try is mixed martial arts. \n\nWhat's mixed martial arts? It's a combination of different fighting styles strategies which include karate, jujitsu, judo, tae kwon do and a couple of others. Since each one takes time to learn, your youngster may have to learn the principles of one before moving forward to the remainder. \n\nBut why mixed martial arts? It is because the activity increases not just your childs bodily health but also psychological as well. Even though strong, they reach work which reduces the danger of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and even obesity. \n\nGreater kids will think twice about bullying them since they understand how to defend themselves when they are confronted. They'll also become more self confident and be more assertive after finishing a number of sessions. \n\nCan learning mixed martial arts make your child crazy? The answer is no because many studies have found that those who begin fights in school are usually the ones who've no training, no control and no self-confidence. To read additional information, please consider looking at: <a href=\"http://www.leccoworkshop.com/how-to-give-your-self-a-brazilian-bikini-wax-2/\">crazy 88 bjj</a>. This is their way of seeking attention even though you can find alternative methods to obtain it. \n\nStudies have shown understanding mixed martial arts has a powerful effect for children that are struggling with ADD and ADHD as it helps them stay focus on a job after doing some thing over repeatedly which in-the long term can help them later on in living as this helps them control the symptoms of those two conditions. \n\nBefore enrolling your child in a mixed martial arts system, do some research by checking the various gyms or dojos offering this to children. \n\nYou could be surprised to know that there's a type named Krav Maga which is an Israeli developed fight program which shows you to escape from an opponent and then fleeing so you can get help which has served saved lives. \n\nWhatever the case, you must also watch a couple of classes and also consult with the teachers. Provide your child over because many will allow your child join an introductory class at no extra charge, If you should be pleased with how they answered your questions. \n\nIf you child likes it, then it is time and energy to register. Know that some gyms may charge you for the next 6 months. As your son or daughter may change their mind as time goes by and enjoy it today, see if you can pay for this on a monthly basis. \n\nAlthough not every child may like mixed martial arts being a recreational activity. If this is the case, attempt to find something else that they are into so you are able to find something that is great for their over all psychological physical and mental well being. \n\nMixed martial arts the same as any game might help in your childs development. They'll become more responsible, more mature and less likely to participate in violence so they grow up and become decent members of society. So give it a shot and see if she or he wants it. They dont need to participate if they dont need to but if they prefer to give a take to to it afterwards, only support them.",

        "notes": "Dampak Lingkungan Industri Kertas \r\n\r\nMeskipun sudah banyak sekali perusahaan yang muncul yang bergerak pada industri kertas, anda perlu memahami bahwa sekarang ini banyak juga yang menentang aktifitas industri kertas tersebut. Hal ini menjadi semakin bermasalah ketika orang mulai membahas efek negatif pada lingkungan yang disebabkan aktifitas industri kertas tersebut. Meskipun ada pula yang sudah mengaplikasikan industri kertas dengan baik seperti oleh perusahaan PT Blabak Kertas, pada kenyataannya permasalahan lingkungan tetap mejadi sebuah hal yang umum dibicarakan diluar sana. Nanti saya akan bahas apa yang sudah dilakukan perusahaan tersebut dalam menanggulangi masalah lingkungan industri kertas. Namun sebelum itu saya akan bahas mengenai apa saja yang menjadi masalah pada lingkungan yang berkaitan dengan industri kertas. \r\n\r\nHutan menanggulangi sekitar 5000-6000 dari karbon dunia atau dengan kata lain, hutan sangat penting berfungsi sebagai penyerap karbon yang mana merupakan sumber polusi utama yang dapat menyebabkan pemanasan worldwide. Pada kenyataannya, hampir setengah hutan diseluruh dunia telah dieksploitasi dan dibakar. Perlu anda tahu bahwa 42-piece dari hasil panen kayu hutan digunakan untuk membuat kertas atau industri kertas. Industri kertas merupakan penyumbang terbesar ke 4 untuk emisi gas rumah kaca diberbagai negara contemporary dan memberikan kontribusi 3 months dari emisi karbon sektor manufaktur. Meskipun PT Blabak Kertas telah mengaplikasikan metode yang aman dalam bergelut pada sektor industri kertas, namun tentu tidak akan berdampak cukup signifikan dalam mengurangi apa yang sudah terjadi pada lingkungan diluar sana. \r\n\r\nMengenai PT Blabak Kertas \r\n\r\nNama seperti Suganto Abo tentu sudah tidak asing bagi banyak orang yang terlibat pada sektor industri kertas. Akan tetapi perlu diperhatikan bahwa tidak semua orang paham apa yang menjadikan perusahaan yang saya sebut diatas memiliki kualitas yang bagus pada ekonomi dunia. Sebelum membahas mengenai kontribusi perusahaan tersebut dalam mengurangi permasalahan lingkungan, anda perlu tahu lahan yang digunakan perusahaan itu untuk beroperasi. Sekarang ini position perusahaan tersebut masih menggunakan hak guna bangunan yang mana belum menggunakan lahan sendiri sehingga pasti memiliki tanggung jawab besar dalam melakukan perawatan john manajemen lingkungan hidup. \r\n\r\nYang menjadi sebuah hal menarik dari PT Blabak Kertas adalah mengenai bagaimana perusahaan tersebut dapat melakukan pengelolaan lingkungan yang baik dalam menjalankan produksi dan juga industri kertas dalam keseharian. Yang pertama adalah mengenai pengendalian pencemaran air. Pada kenyataannya perusahaan tersebut telah membangung IPAL pada tahun 2005 yang mana merupakan salah satu sistem pengendalian air limbah yang mampu mengurangi efek negatifnya pada lingkungan. Mengenai kapasitas yang dimiliki sistem tersebut, anda akan menjumpai jumlah kapasitas yang terpasang yaitu sebesar 5000 kubik perharinya. Ini tentu merupakan sebuah sistem yang signifikan john amat diperlukan oleh semua perusahaan industri kertas untuk menanggulangi permasalahan lingkungan diluar sana. \r\n\r\nYang kedua adalah mengenai bagaimana perusahaan tersebut melakukan pengendalian terhadap pencemaran udara. Sudah menjadi pengetahuan umum bahwa pencemaran udara adalah masalah utama bagi semua perusahaan yang bergerak pada sektor industri. Ini akan menjadi sebuah hal yang menantang bagi para pemilik industri kertas guna mengurangi dampak negatif industri kertas diluar sana. Lalu apa yang dilakukan PT Blabak Kertas dalam mengurangi efek negatif dari pencemaran udara? Merek melakukan pemeliharaan rutin terhadap furnace batubara. Mereka juga telah mengoptimalkan operasional pembersih debu beserta gas buang. Visiting <a href=\"http://www.purevolume.com/maple8liquid/posts/4633562/Kualitas+Perusahaan+Industri+Kertas\">this page is not affiliated</a> seemingly provides cautions you could tell your sister. Tentu itu merupakan hal wajib yang perlu dilakukan guna membuat industri tersebut ramah lingkungan lagi. \r\n\r\nSatu lagi yang perlu diperhatikan mengenai usaha dari bisnis industri kertas tersebut adalah mengenai bagaimana mereka melakukan pengelolaan limbah padat dalam proses produksi yang mereka punya dalam industri kertas. Mengenai apa yang mereka lakukan guna menjaga lingkungan dalam aspek pengelolaan limbah padat, anda akan jumpai fakta bahwa mereka memiliki TPS didua lokasi yaitu TPS 1 john TPS 2. Tentu saja hal ini merupakan sebuah hal yang wajib bagi semua pemilik industri kertas. THERAPIST Blabak Kertas tentu saja merupakan produsen yang mana memiliki perhatian lebih dalam mengelola lingkungan hidup. Tentu hal ini amat signifikan untuk dipertimbangkan.",

        "notes": "A New Lanthanum (III) coordination compound [La(PIP)2?2H2O](NO3)3 (PIP=2-phenyl-imazole[5,6-f]-1,10 phenanthroline) was synthesized. Its structure, optical gap, fluorescence properties and thermal properties were characterized by 1HNMR, elemental analysis, FT-IR spectra, UV-VIS spectra, fluorescence spectra, and DTA-TG technique. The results show that the complex has excellent thermal stability properties. The optical gap is 4.08eV. A Strong pure green emission at 543nm was found under the optimum excitation wavelength 437 nm. These results can be used in further studies of the structural and functional properties of electrolumescence devices based on the La-PIP assembly.  http://www.sjfcd.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=1036",

Most of the existing algorithms do not take temporal redundancy specific Log Files into consideration. We propose a Non Linear based Classifier which introduces a multidimensional log file compression scheme described in eight variants, differing in complexity and attained compression ratios. The FELFCNCA scheme introduces a transformation for log file whose compressible output is far better than general purpose algorithms. This proposed method was found lossless and fully automatic.

These advances have affected Institutions of Higher Education as well. Institutions of Higher Education, however, have different IT requirements. These differences are determined partly by the type of hardware and software that they use. At a time when business entities are striving to minimize costs without compromising the quality of services rendered, the choice as to what software to acquire must reflect considerations such as costs, infrastructure, equipment, management, accessibility and modernity. These are the advantages that are borne with the acquisition of a VMware View, used for the creation of a virtual desktop. The School of Law at the University of the Witwatersrand is the first School within the university to use VMware; and among the first within the Southern African region. Just as recently introduced, its impact is already being felt in different aspects \u2013 cost minimization, minimal utilization of space, efficacy, etc. Personal experiences, informal conversations with other users within and outside the university community, dictate to us the unbeatable advantages and benefits of using VMware. This paper considers the various options available for the acquisition and management of virtual desktops in Institutions of Higher Education, and highlights its advantages.\r\n",

                "description": "In this paper, we consider the problem of Multiuser Detection (MUD) in Direct Sequence/Code Division Multiple Access (DS/CDMA) communication systems. The optimum detector for MUD is the Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, but its complexity is very high and involves an exhaustive search to reach the best fitness of the transmitted and received data. Thus, there has been considerable interest in suboptimal multiuser detectors with less complexity and reasonable performance. If we look to the problem from an optimization viewpoint, what makes our work difficult is high interaction and Epistasis among variables which should be optimized. We propose to work on the problem and try to reduce its complexity instead of using more complex and powerful optimization algorithms. To do so, we analyze problem carefully and propose a new method to overcome Epistasis. In this paper, by using sign detector and longer code lengths in DS/CDMA system, a simple detector will be proposed. This method is compared with ML and two model-free optimization methods: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms which have been used for MUD in DS/CDMA. Simulation results show our method dramatic efficiency.\r\n",

                "description": "A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes which have the ability to communicate with each other without having fixed network infrastructure or any central base station. Individual nodes are responsible for dynamically discovering other nodes that they can directly communicate with. Communication between nodes may be achieved by means of Route Discovery and maintenance. Because of mobility nature, discovery task is more complex. A black hole is a malicious node that falsely replies to any route requests without having active route to specified destination and drops all the receiving packets. Black Hole Attack can be easily deployed by the adversary. If these malicious nodes work together as a group then the damage will be very serious. This type of attack is called cooperative black hole attack. A neighborhood based method to detect whether there exists a black hole attack and a routing recovery protocol to set up a correct path to the true destination. We propose a complete protocol to detect a chain of cooperating malicious nodes in an ad hoc network that disrupts transmission of data by feeding wrong routing information. In this model, the nodes authenticate each other by issuing security certificate with digital signature to all the other nodes in the network. This model is capable of detecting and removing black hole nodes in the MANET also with a secured route discovery by means of an algorithm termed as endairA algorithm.\r\n",

In this paper, it is shown that a cubic B-spline filter can be used to improve the non-linear image enhancement method. In the non-linear image enhancement, a higher-frequency component can be predicted to solve the blurred problem of an enlarged image. This paper also presents a new three-dimensional (3-D) down-scaling scheme to subsample video data for video coding. Furthermore, a novel non-linear image-enhancement compensation algorithm with cubic B-spline filter is presented to improve the prediction of higher-frequency component and accordingly the efficiency of the 3-D down-scaling video coding. Finally, a computer simulation shows that the proposed method yields a better quality of the decoded image than other non-linear enhancement methods.",

Nevertheless, they are usually chosen due to their simplicity and not their performance as they are not always suitable compared to the human observer. In this work we present a Rate-Distortion approach to color image compression based on subband transforms using perceptual optimization of the compression quality. This approach is based on minimization of the Weighted Mean Square Error (WMSE) of the encoded image, which better corresponds to the quality assessment of the human eye. The WMSE can be measured in the YCbCr color space, for which visual weights are relatively easily derived. Based on the new approach, new optimized compression algorithms are introduced using the Discrete Cosine Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. We compare the new algorithms to presently available algorithms such as JPEG and JPEG2000. Our conclusion is that the new WMSE optimization approach outperforms presently available compression systems when a human observer is considered.\r\n",

Because of the permeability differences in the rock reservoir, a large part of the fluid injected can migrate to undesired regions. Therefore, viscous fluids are used to modify the permeability of certain regions of the rock formation. The products added to the fluids that provide this characteristic are called divergent agents. There are a large number of commercial products that can be used for this purpose, but the fluids prepared with them must have special properties. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these products in advance. This work examines the chemical structure and physic-chemical properties of commercial surfactants to identify those with potential application as divergent agents. To do this, the rheological behaviour of the commercial formulations was tested considering temperature and pH conditions typical of reservoirs.",

Paraffin/polyurethane foams composite with flame retardant as thermal energy storage materials were prepared by absorbing paraffin in honeycomb structure of polyurethane rigid foams. These composites provide a new energy saving materials, which can be used for building heating/cooling systems, and the composites can also enhance the thermal comfort for residents. In the composites, paraffin was used as the phase change material (PCM), polyurethane (PU) rigid foams acting as the supporting material, or as nano-structured calcium carbonate (nano-CC) and red phosphorus (RP) acting as the flame retardant. The thermal properties, such as phase change temperature and latent heat, were investigated by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Chemical structure, micro-structure and flame retardant properties of paraffin/ polyurethane foams composite were determined by FT-IR, SEM and limited oxygen index (LOI) tester, respectively. The SEM results showed that paraffin was well dispersed in honeycomb structure of polyurethane rigid foams. The DSC results indicated that the composites melt at 80.3\u2103 with a latent heat of 25.8kJ/kg when the mass percentage of paraffin in the composites was 16.7%. The LOI results showed that nano-CC and RP decreased the flammability of the composites.",

Under this condition, buckling failure of casing has greater impact on normal production. According to adjacent balance criterion and higher differential equation, a determination method of buckling load for eccentric cementing casing was established. This avoids complex modeling and discretization processes when determining the critical buckling load of casing, and geometrical and physical parameters can directly be put in the formula of critical buckling load. There exists 8.3% relative error, comparing critical load from the formula with the result by using finite element method. That means the results are accurate. This method has the advantage of direct calculation and is easy for engineering applications without complex modeling and discretization processes.",

The catalyst pellet used in this reactor was Co-Mo/Al2O3. At first, using the experimental data, a power law kinetic model was developed for hydrodesulphurization reaction. Then a pseudo-homogeneous two-dimensional dynamic model was proposed to describe the concentration profile in the reactor bed. The simulation obtained with the proposed dynamic model showed good agreement with experimental data and the sulfur concentration error in the reactor outlet was 3.8 percent compared to the experimental data. Two dimension modeling revealed that the radial variation of sulfur concentration is more in the reactor inlet than the outlet, but in general the concentration profile can be considered in one dimension. Unsteady reactor modeling showed that the transition time was higher in the reactor outlet and estimated to be 11667 seconds.",

A five-level-four-factorial Central Composite Design (CCD) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the process variables for minimizing the FFA of JCO and maximizing the JCB (%) yield. The high FFA (14.6%) of JCO could be reduced to 0.34% by its pretreatment with methanol (6.5:1) using H2SO4 as catalyst (1.5% v/v) in 125 min time at 50oC temperature. A JCB yield of 98.3% was achieved with methanol/oil molar ratio (11:1) using NaOH as catalyst (1% w/w) in 110 min time at 55oC temperature. Second-order model equations were obtained to predict the FFA content and JCB yield as a function of input parameters. The models can be successfully adopted in fuel industry to reduce the FFA content of JCO and maximize the yield of methyl esters, thereby, improving the economy of the process. The prepared JCB conformed to the ASTM and IS standards specifications.\r\n",

                "description": "Sand production like water and gas production is one of the perennial problems plaguing the oil industry because of its safety, economics or environmental impact on production. In order to properly optimise production and monitor sand controlled well, it is imperative to evaluate the well performance, sand control effectiveness and durability of the treatment type installed in order to achieve the main aim of hydrocarbon production. The principal methods of sand control that are available to oil industry in Nigeria are internal gravel pack (IGP) and sand control using chemicals (SCON). This paper compares the principal methods of sand control measures installed in terms of their effect on performance, durability and sand control effectiveness in Niger Delta. Production and well data from 10 different wells were gotten for their flow rate, sand production and water production. Actual and ideal productivity index are calculated. Well inflow quality indicator (WIQI) was used as a criteria to determine the performance of the well for their treatment types. A graph of the production data was plotted against time (years). A bar chart of the treatment type before installation is plotted against time (years) and also a bar chart of sand produced after the treatment type installed was made to determine the durability and sand production effectiveness of the treatment types installed. The result show that SCON wells have better performance than IGP wells with WIQI values ranges from 0.6 \u2013 1 to that of 0.2 \u2013 0.6 for IGP wells. SCON wells recorded 2-4 years to that of 6 \u2013 12 years of IGP wells for durability. SCON wells recorded sand production of about 55Ib/1000bbl, to that of 34Ib/1000bbl, for IGP wells after their installations. Based on these findings IGP wells are recommended for Niger Delta formation.",

                "description": " The present study examined the growth and the CO2 production of indigenous microbial cultures collected from three zones in Chicontepec oil reservoir located in Veracruz, Mexico. Two microbial cultures, coded as NW O and CW O, showed an accelerated growth and higher CO2 production when molasses were used as carbon source. They were selected and identified by molecular-biology techniques as potential candidates to be used in future Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery studies. To improve CO2 production, a reformulated culture medium was evaluated using only the culture coded as NW O which showed the better growth. Results showed that the reformulated culture medium caused an increase in the production of CO2 from 1.64gL-1to 3.13 gL-1 by the NW O culture. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries allowed the identification of fermentative microorganisms; the NW O culture is composed of Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and Thermotoga neapolitana; the CW O culture is composed of Caldanaerobacter subterraneus.\r\n",

                "description": "Several parameters affect the chemical reactions between CO2/fluid/rock: pressure, temperature, rock type, and brine composition. Brine composition includes salt concentration and type. Pink Desert limestone cores were used to conduct a series of coreflood experiments to address the effect of brine composition on the chemical reactions between carbonic acid and limestone rock. The experiments were designed to simulate the water alternating gas (WAG) injection of CO2 into saline carbonate aquifers. Supercritical CO2 and brines were injected at flow rates of 2 and 5 cm3/min at 70 and 200&amp;#176;F. Seawater, formation brine, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride brines were used in this study. A commercial compositional simulator was used to simulate the coreflood experiments at the lab conditions. The reaction rate constant of CO2 with calcite at different brine compositions was adjusted to match the calcium concentration obtained in the lab. Experimental data was used to predict the reaction rate constant between CO2/brine/rock and found to be increasing as the brine salinity increased (Log(k25)= -9.2) when CO2 dissolves in DI water, and -6.2 when CO2 dissolves in 5 wt% CaCl2 brine). A simulation study conducted on field scale showed that after 30 years of CO2 injection and 1400 years after injection stopped, brine composition does not affect the trapping mechanism of CO2 in the aquifer.",

                "description": " Studies have shown that the same mechanism is responsible for the accumulation of huge energy in reservoirs and inability to obtain inflow from potentially productive layer. Considering the process of chemical adsorption in layers, it managed to show that when the fluid flows into the reservoir, even moderate magnitudes of over balance internal electromagnetic radiation occur. Under the influence of this radiation, certain order of direction and intensity oscillations of phonons is set. Regard to borehole maximum intensity, oscillations of phonons will take place in the zone of high tangential stresses. Therefore, at some depth from the borehole, wall rock will be destroyed into particles commensurable with clay. Behind the transition layer due to throw of electromagnetic energy into the reservoir and fluid, mass transfer from the periphery of the reservoir to an extended zone with stepwise increased porosity and high thermodynamic compressibility of fluid is formed. Inside this zone a strong and long-range interaction between particles of fluid is developing. Throw in of electromagnetic energy is a result of intensive electromagnetic radiation due to the inflow into the reservoir mud or kill fluid. This formation is called the associate. The associate emits electromagnetic waves that change over allogenic particles in porous medium beyond the associate in the excited state. Between associate and excited particle strong interaction set in, which manifested in attraction of particle to the associate, and it becomes a full member of the associate. Thus, there is a selective implication of allogenic fluid particles into the associate.\r\n",

It is observed that the cationic surfactants induced cooperative binding with the anionic polyelectrolyte at critical aggregation concentration (cac) and the cac values are considerably lower than the corresponding critical micelle concentration (cmc) for each of the surfactant irrespective of their hydrophobic tail size. The cmc of surfactants were observed at slightly higher surfactant concentration in polyelectrolyte solution than that in pure water.

Comparative performance cooling curve of a number of vegetable oil basestocks commercially available in Brazil was reported previously. These basestocks included: soybean, canola, corn, cottonseed and sunflower oils. However, these particular vegetable oils exhibit very poor thermal-oxidative stability, relative to petroleum oil, which is attributable to their molecular composition. To address this specific deficiency which affects long-term performance, a number of additional vegetable oils with much more favorable molecular structure were examined including: peanuit (groundnut) oil and coconut oil. To assess the quenching performance compared to conventional and accelerated quenching oils, cooling curve performance according to ASTM D6200 for two bath temperatures (60 &#176;C and 90 &#176;C) was determined. In addition, effective heat transfer coefficients were calculated and compared. It is noteworthy that the vegetable oils evaluated did not exhibit classical film boiling or nucleate boiling behavior during quenching.\r\n",

Data were gathered during a period of four months in two horizontal well of an oil field with the aim of assessing the relationship between Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and drilling efficiency trough the analysis of the most significant drilling parameters. There are several models and measurement systems available for measuring such parameters, however in many practical cases the possible maximum performances are not achieved and this suggests the idea that there is still room, from a research point of view, to increase acquisition accuracy and their correct evaluation. In this study, down hole data were acquired to calculate significant parameters for assessing drilling performances which can contribute to the avoidance of errors in torque calculation due to the effect of drill string friction and the consequent distortion of MSE curve. Moreover, the same data implemented in a model for Rate of Penetration (ROP) calculation and a map correlating RPM and Weight on Bit (WOB) values with Rate of Penetration was drawn.",

                "description": "In this study pervaporation (PV) of ethyl butyrate (ETB)/water mixtures using synthesized poly (ether-block-amide) (PEBA) membranes was investigated. The membranes were made via solution casting on water surface (as non solvent). After studying the effects of different parameters on the membranes morphology, it was found that the mixture of (1 n-butanol/ 3 iso-propyl alcohol), temperature range from 70-800C and polymer concentration range from 4-7 wt could be used to obtain uniform membranes. PV separation of ETB/water mixtures was carried out using these membranes. The results showed that with increasing ETB concentration, both total permeation flux and ETB separation factor increase. Increasing temperature, in the studied limited range, resulted in decreasing separation factor and increasing permeation flux. With decreasing permeate pressure, permeation flux increased and separation factor decreased. Overall mass transfer coefficient was evaluated using steady state ETB permeation flux equation. Membrane mass transfer coefficient, boundary layer thickness and liquid boundary layer mass transfer coefficient were calculated using the modified concentration polarization equation and the resistance in series model. Concentration polarization index (using membrane and liquid boundary layer mass transfer coefficients) was defined and used to present extent of the concentration polarization phenomenon. The modified Arrhenius model was used to correlate ETB permeation flux and the operating temperature. Good agreement was observed between the experimental results and the model predictions. Results showed that the effect of temperature on sorption is greater than that on diffusion.\r\n",

                "description": "Relative permeability curves of low permeability cores with different permeability were obtained through displacement experiments, including water flooding and surfactant flooding. Changes of the relative permeability curves before and after injecting surfactants with different interfacial tensions were contrasted. The relative permeability curves of water flooding had the following characteristics: relatively narrower two-phase region, lower water relative permeability at residual oil saturation, higher residual oil saturation(37.6%, 39.7% and 40.5%, respectively), and lower ultimate oil recovery(only 37.3%, 27.8% and 23.6%, respectively). While oil/water interfacial tension decreased from 16mN/m to 7.1&#215;10-4mN/m, the two-phase region became wider, and residual oil saturation decreased. At the same time, water relative permeability at residual oil saturation increased, and ultimate oil recovery increased by 13.6%, 15.6% and 16.4% respectively. And the lower the interfacial tension is, the better the effect of enhancing oil recovery is. In general, surfactants have a great application prospect on the oil field development of low and extremely low permeability reservoir, and the oil-water interfacial tension should be reduced as far as possible.",

The operating conditions of the designed experiments were coil outlet temperature (COT), feed flow rate and steam ratio (STR). A group of these experiments were conducted to determine the coke formation rate. Central composite design methodology was utilized to set the experiments and analysis the results. Some statistical tests were used for confirmation of the accuracy, consistency and reproducibility of experimental results. Moreover, statistical model was utilized for investigation of the coke formation rate. To determine the yield distribution of main products a reaction network consists of 21 reactions together with the related kinetic reactions rates were developed. Based on the developed models and utilizing suitable optimization algorithm, the best operating conditions were determined. The results declared that at the 883.9\u00b0C as coil outlet temperature,0.62 as steam ratio and residence time equal to 0.3 sec the optima levels were obtained in which the yield of ethylene, propylene and butadienes were respectively equal to 28.73%,12.33% and 4.02%.",

Recharge pits, made up of readily available materials, are a simple, cost effective and satisfactory method for recharging ground water storage where an impermeable layer does not allow natural charge of ground water. Recharge pits of rectangular shape (1.7 x 1.4m) with depth of 1.80 m were dug and constructed in series in a micro watershed of area 1.78 hectare in Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh, India. Experimental studies were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and results indicated that logarithmic equations were best fitted for determining the rate of ground water recharge in Eastern Nimar valley region. It was also observed that about 32.74% of runoff may be allowed for ground water recharge by adopting the method. The findings of the study may be adopted for planning and management of ground water by the different stakeholders in water scarce area or where ground water is becoming a scarce resource.",

Assessment on water-bodies as well as escribing on its characteristics is the most crucial work to be done in India where land is being occupied at a very high rate. Satellite images are not clear all the time and will have shadow effects, which has to identified and distinguished. Water body image may appear similar to shades of huge buildings due to reflection and echoing. Few substantial research have been conducted to extract information about water bodies from several multi-resolution satellite images. This paper proposes a novel methodology based on texture and spectral information of the satellite images to extract water bodies.",

                "description": "The objective of this research is to compare dry anaerobic digestion of cow dung for methane production with wet anaerobic digestion under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures in batch cultures for 63 days. The results showed that a specific methane yield of 0.333 and 0.345 LCH4/gVSr was obtained at 35oC in the fermentation systems for a dilute ratio of 1:1 and 1:0, with a VS removal of 50.01%, and 56.33%, a COD removal of 54.99%, and 61.35%, respectively. When the fermentation systems was performed under 55oC, the specific methane yield was increased to 0.351 and 0.374 LCH4/gVSr, with a VS removal of 53.43% and 60.52%, and a COD removal of 58.37% and 65.36%, respectively. Though addition of water could promote start-up process and biodegradability of the substrate to some extent, the methane yields in the dry anaerobic digestion process were found comparable to the conventional wet anaerobic digestion process. Furthermore, the volume of the reactor was increased twice in the wet fermentation process (7.68% TS) of cow dung compared to the dry fermentation (15.18% TS) at the same loading rate. It was suggested that dry methane fermentation process was superior in energy recovery, saving resources and engineering investment compared with wet fermentation process.",

The water quality index was calculated using indicator parameters viz., pH, turbidity, temperature, nitrates, total phosphate, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total solids, faecal coliforms with respect to its different uses like residential and commercial, as well as indicator parameters, in addition, index value was compared with quality rating to examine the seasonal variation in groundwater quality. The water quality index was observed from 74.0 to 83.0 and 63.0 to 78.0 in pre and post monsoon season, respectively. Our finding indicates that 100 percent (70 samples) groundwater samples were of desirable quality in pre monsoon season but 30 percent (21 samples) of all showed the quality change from well to less fair in post monsoon season, this seasonal variation in water quality rating has indicated the deterioration of water quality in the study area, thus indicating a need of proper treatment before use.",

                "description": "Climate change has affected the climatic parameter characteristics worldwide. Investigations have been carried out by climatologists to find a possible relation of climate change with anthropogenic behavior by studying trends in different climatic parameters. However, the changes are not the same for all regions especially in India due to localized intensity, thus it must be quantified locally to manage the natural resources. Temperature, one of the most important components of climatic parameter, has been widely measured as a starting point towards the apprehension of climate changes courses. The main purpose of this study is to observe the temporal variability of temperature for the period of 1901-2002 (102 years), to improve the hydrological status of Upper Ganga Canal Command located in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as to determine trend in annual mean and monthly Temperature time series using nonparametric methods (i.e. the Mann\u2013Kendall and Sen\u2019s Slope tests). The magnitudes of trend in a Temperature time series have been estimated by Sen\u2019s estimator method. Auto correlation effect is reduced from the Temperature series before the application of the Mann\u2013Kendall test. On annual basis, the analysis of Mann\u2013Kendall test shows increasing (positive) non-significance trend in temperature time series over Upper Ganga Canal Command. Thus, in the study area, the temperature is increasing, which leads to the increment in evaporation, warmer days and nights in summer.",

                "description": " In the thermal hydraulic experiments to determinate parameters of heat transfer, where fuel rod simulators are heated by electric current, the preservation of the simulators are essential when the heat flux goes to the critical point. One of the most important limits in the design of cooling water reactors is the condition that the heat transfer co-efficiently by boiling in the core to deteriorate itself. The heat flux just before deterioration is denominated as critical heat flux (CHF). At this time the small increase in the heat flux or in the inlet temperature of the cooler in the core, or the small decrease in the inlet flux of cooling, results in changes in the heat transfer mechanism. This causes increases in the surface temperature of the fuel elements leading to failures at the fuel (burnout). This paper describes the experiments conducted to detection of critical heat flux in nuclear fuel element simulators carried out in the thermal-hydraulic laboratory of Nuclear Technology Development Centre (CDTN). It is concluded that the use of displacement transducer is the most efficient technique for detecting critical heat flux in nuclear simulators heated by electric current in open pool.",

                "description": " Numerical simulation was carried out to study the turbulent mixing behaviour of two opposite flows inside a square chimney model of a pool type research reactor. This type of chimney structure is often used for open pool type reactors to prevent mixing of core outlet water directly into the pool. The chimney design facilitates guiding of the radioactive water from the reactor core towards the side outlet nozzles and simultaneously allows drawing water from the reactor pool through the chimney top opening. This helps to limit the radioactivity level at the pool top to a lower limit. The present work aims at studying the turbulent mixing inside a 2/9th scaled down model of chimney structure. The Reynolds numbers considered in the simulation are 1.36\u00d7106, 1.81\u00d7106, 2.26\u00d7106 and 2.72\u00d7106 which correspond to upward core flow of 12.5, 16.67, 20.83 and 25 kg/s respectively. The core bypass flow which is sucked in the downward direction varies to 0, 5, 10 and 15% of the core flow. The effects of flow ratio between the upward flow and downward flow on the mixing behaviour are analysed using PHOENICS code. Turbulence is modelled by using the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation. The results indicate that increase in downward flow causes the jet height to decrease. It is observed that the jet height mainly depends on the ratio of core bypass flow and core flow. The effect of change on core flow is insignificant.",

For the assessment on freshness of seafoods, so far, sensory, microbiological\u3000and biochemical methods are used. However, these are not appropriate method for large quantities. In this case, optical methods have advantages of quickness and nondestruction. In this review, biochemical changes during storage are described as a theoretical basis of the freshness evaluation and several current topics on optical noninvasive methods are introduced. Fluorescence of NADH has been applied to scallop adductor muscle, which showed that transient increase in fluorescence intensity was followed by the decrease until 2days of observation . Based on absorption spectra of squid hemocyanin, the oxygen dissociation curve shifted to the left during storage,which suggested that the affinity of oxygen depends on freshness. As for the transparency of squid mantle, new technology with transmittance permitted to analyze the changes to turbid state. The results were almost consistent with that obtained from the sensory test. The range applied to these new methods is still narrow but many results obtained would be reported in the near future.",

                "description": "Industrial wet phosphoric acid production in Tunisia has led to the accumulation of high amounts of waste phosphogypsum by-products which are stocked mainly in piles. This harmful waste has still caused much anxiety and problems for the living especially in Sfax region (South-East of Tunisia) where it is rejected. In this paper two samples of Tunisian phosphogypsum, differing in their age, were analyzed by different analytical methods in order to compare and study the effect of impurities presence on gypsum\u2019s properties. Infrared spectroscopy allowed the observation of phosphoric acid and fluorosilicates absorption bands as well as the determination of the P/S ratio. X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the presence of impurities of HPO42- (crystallized in ardealite and brushite phases) and SiF62- (crystallized in malladrite phase) in phosphogypsum samples. A shaped-needles phase observed only in old sample micrographs corresponded to the brushite phase. Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis showed the influence of impurities on the thermal behavior of dehydrated calcium sulfate. Elemental analysis was provided with respect to scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray technique, X-ray fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and selective electrode analysis. Optical properties investigated by photoluminescence measurements allowed not only the identification of the matrix emissions but also the observation of Cd2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ impurities showing thus their presence in the studied phosphogypsum samples.\r\n",

John McCain, R-Ariz., speaks Monday following a White House meeting with President Obama. Both senators are calling for a tough military response against Syria.</br>A defiant Syrian President Bashar Assad said Monday that the international community has not produced evidence to substantiate claims that his regime used chemical weapons in a deadly attack last month.   \"Those who make accusations must show evidence. We have challenged the United States and France to come up with a single piece of proof. (Presidents) Obama and Hollande have been incapable of doing so,\" Assad told the French newspaper Le Figaro in an interview in Damascus.   Assad has made few public appearances and given few interviews since an uprising began more than two years ago. But with the U.S. and France favoring military action, the Syrian leader said such strikes could unleash much greater violence across the region.   \"The Middle East is barrel of powder and today the flames are creeping closer. It is not just a question of the Syrian response but what else might happen after the first (Western) air strike,\" Assad said. \"Everyone will lose control of the situation when the powder barrel explodes.\"</br>United Nations inspectors left Syria on Saturday after collecting evidence on the Aug. 21 attack that left more than 1,400 people dead in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. The U.N. findings have not yet been made public. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that tests showed sarin gas was used, though he did not say who conducted the tests.   Obama, meanwhile, hosted two key Republican senators who have been pressing for a much tougher approach toward Assad.   John McCain of Arizona and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina emerged from the White House meeting and said it was critical that the president make a strong case to Congress if he hopes to win congressional backing for military action against Syria.   The senators support striking against Syria but said they want to see sustained U.S. efforts to degrade Assad's forces and upgrade the rebels.   Asked if he supported U.S. efforts to arm the rebels, McCain said, \"We should have done it two years ago.\"   The senator said the U.S.<span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://i1335.photobucket.com/albums/w679/yantisuma/tas/GUCCI/NewamplimitedGUCCISunrisewaterproofSemsupBlacksize35x28cmdustbagserticardmdlslempangRp275rb_zpsc5be51df.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://g3.ykimg.com/0100641F4651014AE4C50C0176FA509FA43046-696E-D281-8E65-21AA9CBC01AC\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> should specifically target the Syrian air force, which has been used to pound rebels throughout the country.

While McCain and Graham have been leading voices on Syria, they are considered to be among a small number in Congress who favor a relatively large-scale operation.   Obama is expected to face opposition from a larger number of Republicans and Democrats who are either against military action or are skeptical about what it might achieve.<b>Michael Kors Outlet</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.michaelkorsukbagsoutlet.com\">Michael Kors UK, Shop Fashion Michael Kors Bags At Michael Kors UK Outlet Store Online</a><br /><a href=\"http://journals.fotki.com/lorarmhz553rvfos98c/e269063890e269063890eeeee/entry/wqgbqkdkrgfrt/\">http://journals.fotki.com/lorarmhz553rvfos98c/e269063890e269063890eeeee/entry/wqgbqkdkrgfrt/</a>",

We have challenged the United States and France to come up with a single piece of proof. (Presidents) Obama and Hollande have been incapable of doing so,\" Assad told the French newspaper Le Figaro in an interview in Damascus.   Assad has made few public appearances and given few interviews since an uprising began more than two years ago. But with the U.S. and France favoring military action, the Syrian leader said such strikes could unleash much greater violence across the region.   \"The Middle East is barrel of powder and today the flames are creeping closer. It is not just a question of the Syrian response but what else might happen after the first (Western) air strike,\" Assad said. \"Everyone will lose control of the situation when the powder barrel explodes.\"</br>United Nations inspectors left Syria on Saturday after collecting evidence on the Aug. 21 attack that left more than 1,400 people dead in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. The U.N. findings have not yet been made public. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that tests showed sarin gas was used, though he did not say who conducted the tests.   Obama, meanwhile, hosted two key Republican senators who have been pressing for a much tougher approach toward Assad.   John McCain of Arizona and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina emerged from the White House meeting and said it was critical that the president make a strong case to Congress if he hopes to win congressional backing for military action against Syria.   The senators support striking against Syria but said they want to see sustained U.S. efforts to degrade Assad's forces and upgrade the rebels.   Asked if he supported U.S. efforts to arm the rebels, McCain said, \"We should have done it two years ago.\"   The senator said the U.S.<span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://i1335.photobucket.com/albums/w679/yantisuma/tas/GUCCI/NewamplimitedGUCCISunrisewaterproofSemsupBlacksize35x28cmdustbagserticardmdlslempangRp275rb_zpsc5be51df.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://g3.ykimg.com/0100641F4651014AE4C50C0176FA509FA43046-696E-D281-8E65-21AA9CBC01AC\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> should specifically target the Syrian air force, which has been used to pound rebels throughout the country.

While McCain and Graham have been leading voices on Syria, they are considered to be among a small number in Congress who favor a relatively large-scale operation.   Obama is expected to face opposition from a larger number of Republicans and Democrats who are either against military action or are skeptical about what it might achieve.<b>Michael Kors Outlet</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.michaelkorsukbagsoutlet.com\">Michael Kors UK, Shop Fashion Michael Kors Bags At Michael Kors UK Outlet Store Online</a><br /><a href=\"http://journals.fotki.com/lorarmhz553rvfos98c/e269063890e269063890eeeee/entry/wqgbqkdkrgfrt/\">http://journals.fotki.com/lorarmhz553rvfos98c/e269063890e269063890eeeee/entry/wqgbqkdkrgfrt/</a>",

                "description": "<div>Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV), one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the Western US, has seen a rebound in their business, which was hurt hard during the recession because of the regions the company serves, specifically California. Margins troughed for the company in the low 4% range, but have started to turn around, and should return back to the company's historic 6-8% range. This margin expansion creates a minimum 40% upside in the stock going forward. Margin expansion is further supported by a new store concept, favorable lease negotiations, and higher-end (higher-margin) products. BGFV will also enter the e-commerce area in 2014.The company has a &quot;margin of safety&quot; in the fact that even without margin expansion, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples, due in part to an over-blown, recent sell-off after the company's latest quarterly call. As we will talk about later in this article, BGFV's differentiated business model and regional focus also insulates the company from competition.Differentiated Store BaseOne thing that really interests me about BGFV is the location of the store base - the company focuses on the west coast. Here's a breakdown of the current store base by state:(click to enlarge)We see that over 50% of the store base is located in California. Because of this, the company was hurt pretty hard during the recession, but we have seen a strong rebound in CA, which provides more upside for BGFV going forward.Also, this west coast focus creates isolation against competition. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) has only 26 stores (5% of total store base) in California. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) has no presence (see below) in California, and Modell's is only located in the Northeast US. BGFV lists these companies as its major competition!Source: HIBB PresentationThe company has big upside from its presence in CA, and is isolated from competition because of the regions it focuses on.Differentiated store sizeAnother point of differentiation for BGFV is its store size. With an average size of 11,000 square feet, the stores are bigger than an average HIBB unit (5,000 square feet), but much smaller than the DKS concept (50,000 square feet). After following the sporting goods space for several years, my opinion is that this middle-size is perfect - big enough to be off-mall and carry more sporting equipment, but not as big as DKS (there has been some contention over the last year as to the viability of DKS growing to 900 stores if they plan of keeping the store size this big).New store concepts will be smaller, but still fit inside this mid-size concept.New Store ConceptsThe company has been testing a new, smaller store concept. The units have a lower upfront investment ($900K) and have average cash-on-cash returns of 24%. The New concepts also have higher margins (average operating margins of 12%) than the overall store base, which provides further support to the margin expansion story.E-Commerce LaunchSurprisingly, the company has no e-commerce platform as of today. Currently, you can only visit the BGFV website and find the closest store to purchase the item you are looking for.The company has been investing an e-commerce platform, which will launch in 2014. This should be another lever for growth for the company.Recent Sell-off - Q2 EarningsSo far we have a differentiated business model that faces only a small amount of competition from the other major sporting goods retailers. We also have a very interesting margin expansion story. Now, all we need is a good entry price. Lucky for us, we recently received this entry point after a sell-off due to the company's latest earnings call.The stock was sold off on the call for two major reasons, which I highlight below (along with my reason why the concerns were overblown):The company had been repurchasing shares, but stopped in the latest quarter. Also, when asked, the<b>air max 87</b> company guided for flat share count for the rest of the year. (The company has been aggressively paying down debt, and I took the comment for the rest of the year as conservative, as many company tell analysts to model flat share count when they in fact plan on repurchasing shares)Guidance is for the smallest margin increase the company has had in some time (they are comping against the strongest 3rd quarter in the company's history as a public company)I was actually quite impressed by the quarter. Highlights of the call included:Promotional activity decreased in the quarter (this is really good news compared to most of the retail industry)There has been a strong start to Q3Slight improvements in customer traffic and a mid-single-digit increase in average ticketSame-store sales improved for each of the major product category (apparel, footwear and hardgoods)So now we have a strong business model and good entry point. Let's get into detail about the most compelling part of the story - margin expansion.Operating Margins - An Opportunity for Mean ReversionOver the past two years, the company's operating margins have fallen into mid 4% range. Over the longer-term, the company's margins have usually fallen in the 6-8% range. Management believes that margins will return to the historical range based on the following:New store concepts have 12% operating marginsSales leverage as the California/west coast rebound continuesIncreasing merchandise margins - there has been a focus to sell higher-end, higher margins products. This push to higher-end products also further insulates the company against competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) (BGFV's 10-K lists the big box retailers as competition)Favorable real estate costs - management noted that as leases have come up for renewal, they have been able to get more favorable terms (specifically in California).Company is closing underperforming storesE-commerce platform spend goes away next year - the company stated that investment in the e-commerce platform will equal $.05 to $.06 of lower EPS in 2013 because of the increased SG&amp;AWhat's more, if you look at the trailing twelve months of performance, margins have returned to the low end (6.4%) of the range already (even though they are only in the 4.8% range for the last six months).OutlookThe company will do about $1B of revenue on average over the next two years (estimates are for just over $1B with a small range of $1.03-1.09B by seven analysts). Let's take a look at projections assuming no revenue growth and using the 6-8% operating margin range:  LowHigh Revenue ($'000s)$1,000$1,000 Operating Profit$60$80 Net Income$1.57$2.10     Free Cash Flow$36MM$48MM FCF Yield9.5%12.7%     EBITDA$82MM$102MM EV/EBITDA5.1x4.1xNote: Capex is at abnormally high levels in 2013 as the company invests in the e-commerce platform and distribution center. 2014 will see a reduction, which will increase free cash flow and allow for more dividends/share repurchases/debt paydowns.We can see as margins return to their normal levels, the stock becomes very cheap. Since the company will grow stores by 6% this year, the launch of the e-commerce platform in 2014, and the fact that there should be some upside in revenue as the west coast rebounds, these estimates could end up being conservative.A look at the competition's operating margins (DKS around 8% and HIBB around 12%) provides further support to management's 6-8% target.Balance SheetThe company has been aggressively using its free cash flow to<span style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.google.com.hk/intl/zh-TW/options/\">\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd</a></span><span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000456.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/identify-fake-gucci-sunglasses-104001366.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> pay down debt, from $77MM last year to $44MM today. This brings up a strong point - even though the company was at trough margins, it was still producing positive free cash flow.The company has also been using excess free cash to repurchase shares (the decline in purchases was part of the sell-off in the latest quarter). The company also has $6MM in cash and a revolver to fund operations.The company pays a dividend of $.10/quarter (2.4% yield). I expect this dividend to increase to about $.12/quarter next year.ValuationWe have seen what earnings could look like as margins return to normal levels, now let's take a look at the current valuation of BGFV compared to its competition:  P/EEV/EBITDAEV/Sales DKS15.0x9.0x1.0x BGFV11.0x9.0x0.5x HIBB15.5x10.0x1.5xWe see that even though BGFV is currently operating below normal margins, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples. Is this justified? Maybe during the recession, considering the markets BGFV serves, but we have seen a rebound in BGFV's regions (specifically in California) and see a path to margin expansion and EBITDA growth. I would expect that the multiples expand in the near-term, closer to the competitions' multiples. Using an average of 0.75x sales and 14.0x earnings, we get a price target of $24 (about a 40% premium to the current price). I believe these multiples are fair because the company should trade at a discount to its competitors, considering the aggressive growth expansion of the other two names.If we use the high and low end of the future outlook range (see outlook section above), assuming minimal revenue growth and margin expansion to normal ranges, we get a price target range of $24-$30 (40-75% upside - note this valuation range is based on a blend valuation of free cash flow (8% yield), EV/EBITDA (8.0x), and EPS (14.0x)).RisksRisks for the company include:Inability to continue improvement in marginsSensitivity to California economyPoor weather can have a large impact on salesCatalystsCatalysts for the company include:Increased sell-side coverage - on the latest quarterly call, there were only three sell-side analysts (and two buy-side analysts) on the call. Increased coverage could increase demand for the stockFurther margin expansion to the 6-8% target rangeStore expansion - the company will open 15 new stores this yearStrong results at new store conceptsStrong results from remodelsIncreased sales from a continued west coast reboundIncreased sales from the company's entry into e-commerceConclusionAfter a recent, overblown sell-off, investors have been given the opportunity to buy BGFV at a steep discount to its competition. The margin-expansion story has already begun, and will be further supported by new store concepts, higher margin projects, and a rebound in California. The company is isolated from major competition by its focus on the west coast, and should see revenue growth as it launches an e-commerce platform. I believe there is a minimum 40% upside in the name from its current price, and am encouraging investors to buy the stock with an intermediate-term target of $24, and a longer-term target of $30.</br>Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        "notes": "<div>Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV), one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the Western US, has seen a rebound in their business, which was hurt hard during the recession because of the regions the company serves, specifically California. Margins troughed for the company in the low 4% range, but have started to turn around, and should return back to the company's historic 6-8% range. This margin expansion creates a minimum 40% upside in the stock going forward. Margin expansion is further supported by a new store concept, favorable lease negotiations, and higher-end (higher-margin) products. BGFV will also enter the e-commerce area in 2014.The company has a &quot;margin of safety&quot; in the fact that even without margin expansion, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples, due in part to an over-blown, recent sell-off after the company's latest quarterly call. As we will talk about later in this article, BGFV's differentiated business model and regional focus also insulates the company from competition.Differentiated Store BaseOne thing that really interests me about BGFV is the location of the store base - the company focuses on the west coast. Here's a breakdown of the current store base by state:(click to enlarge)We see that over 50% of the store base is located in California. Because of this, the company was hurt pretty hard during the recession, but we have seen a strong rebound in CA, which provides more upside for BGFV going forward.Also, this west coast focus creates isolation against competition. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) has only 26 stores (5% of total store base) in California. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) has no presence (see below) in California, and Modell's is only located in the Northeast US. BGFV lists these companies as its major competition!Source: HIBB PresentationThe company has big upside from its presence in CA, and is isolated from competition because of the regions it focuses on.Differentiated store sizeAnother point of differentiation for BGFV is its store size. With an average size of 11,000 square feet, the stores are bigger than an average HIBB unit (5,000 square feet), but much smaller than the DKS concept (50,000 square feet). After following the sporting goods space for several years, my opinion is that this middle-size is perfect - big enough to be off-mall and carry more sporting equipment, but not as big as DKS (there has been some contention over the last year as to the viability of DKS growing to 900 stores if they plan of keeping the store size this big).New store concepts will be smaller, but still fit inside this mid-size concept.New Store ConceptsThe company has been testing a new, smaller store concept. The units have a lower upfront investment ($900K) and have average cash-on-cash returns of 24%. The New concepts also have higher margins (average operating margins of 12%) than the overall store base, which provides further support to the margin expansion story.E-Commerce LaunchSurprisingly, the company has no e-commerce platform as of today. Currently, you can only visit the BGFV website and find the closest store to purchase the item you are looking for.The company has been investing an e-commerce platform, which will launch in 2014. This should be another lever for growth for the company.Recent Sell-off - Q2 EarningsSo far we have a differentiated business model that faces only a small amount of competition from the other major sporting goods retailers. We also have a very interesting margin expansion story. Now, all we need is a good entry price. Lucky for us, we recently received this entry point after a sell-off due to the company's latest earnings call.The stock was sold off on the call for two major reasons, which I highlight below (along with my reason why the concerns were overblown):The company had been repurchasing shares, but stopped in the latest quarter. Also, when asked, the<b>air max 87</b> company guided for flat share count for the rest of the year. (The company has been aggressively paying down debt, and I took the comment for the rest of the year as conservative, as many company tell analysts to model flat share count when they in fact plan on repurchasing shares)Guidance is for the smallest margin increase the company has had in some time (they are comping against the strongest 3rd quarter in the company's history as a public company)I was actually quite impressed by the quarter. Highlights of the call included:Promotional activity decreased in the quarter (this is really good news compared to most of the retail industry)There has been a strong start to Q3Slight improvements in customer traffic and a mid-single-digit increase in average ticketSame-store sales improved for each of the major product category (apparel, footwear and hardgoods)So now we have a strong business model and good entry point. Let's get into detail about the most compelling part of the story - margin expansion.Operating Margins - An Opportunity for Mean ReversionOver the past two years, the company's operating margins have fallen into mid 4% range. Over the longer-term, the company's margins have usually fallen in the 6-8% range. Management believes that margins will return to the historical range based on the following:New store concepts have 12% operating marginsSales leverage as the California/west coast rebound continuesIncreasing merchandise margins - there has been a focus to sell higher-end, higher margins products. This push to higher-end products also further insulates the company against competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) (BGFV's 10-K lists the big box retailers as competition)Favorable real estate costs - management noted that as leases have come up for renewal, they have been able to get more favorable terms (specifically in California).Company is closing underperforming storesE-commerce platform spend goes away next year - the company stated that investment in the e-commerce platform will equal $.05 to $.06 of lower EPS in 2013 because of the increased SG&amp;AWhat's more, if you look at the trailing twelve months of performance, margins have returned to the low end (6.4%) of the range already (even though they are only in the 4.8% range for the last six months).OutlookThe company will do about $1B of revenue on average over the next two years (estimates are for just over $1B with a small range of $1.03-1.09B by seven analysts). Let's take a look at projections assuming no revenue growth and using the 6-8% operating margin range:  LowHigh Revenue ($'000s)$1,000$1,000 Operating Profit$60$80 Net Income$1.57$2.10     Free Cash Flow$36MM$48MM FCF Yield9.5%12.7%     EBITDA$82MM$102MM EV/EBITDA5.1x4.1xNote: Capex is at abnormally high levels in 2013 as the company invests in the e-commerce platform and distribution center. 2014 will see a reduction, which will increase free cash flow and allow for more dividends/share repurchases/debt paydowns.We can see as margins return to their normal levels, the stock becomes very cheap. Since the company will grow stores by 6% this year, the launch of the e-commerce platform in 2014, and the fact that there should be some upside in revenue as the west coast rebounds, these estimates could end up being conservative.A look at the competition's operating margins (DKS around 8% and HIBB around 12%) provides further support to management's 6-8% target.Balance SheetThe company has been aggressively using its free cash flow to<span style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.google.com.hk/intl/zh-TW/options/\">\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd</a></span><span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000456.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/identify-fake-gucci-sunglasses-104001366.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> pay down debt, from $77MM last year to $44MM today. This brings up a strong point - even though the company was at trough margins, it was still producing positive free cash flow.The company has also been using excess free cash to repurchase shares (the decline in purchases was part of the sell-off in the latest quarter). The company also has $6MM in cash and a revolver to fund operations.The company pays a dividend of $.10/quarter (2.4% yield). I expect this dividend to increase to about $.12/quarter next year.ValuationWe have seen what earnings could look like as margins return to normal levels, now let's take a look at the current valuation of BGFV compared to its competition:  P/EEV/EBITDAEV/Sales DKS15.0x9.0x1.0x BGFV11.0x9.0x0.5x HIBB15.5x10.0x1.5xWe see that even though BGFV is currently operating below normal margins, the company trades at a deep discount to its competition on today's multiples. Is this justified? Maybe during the recession, considering the markets BGFV serves, but we have seen a rebound in BGFV's regions (specifically in California) and see a path to margin expansion and EBITDA growth. I would expect that the multiples expand in the near-term, closer to the competitions' multiples. Using an average of 0.75x sales and 14.0x earnings, we get a price target of $24 (about a 40% premium to the current price). I believe these multiples are fair because the company should trade at a discount to its competitors, considering the aggressive growth expansion of the other two names.If we use the high and low end of the future outlook range (see outlook section above), assuming minimal revenue growth and margin expansion to normal ranges, we get a price target range of $24-$30 (40-75% upside - note this valuation range is based on a blend valuation of free cash flow (8% yield), EV/EBITDA (8.0x), and EPS (14.0x)).RisksRisks for the company include:Inability to continue improvement in marginsSensitivity to California economyPoor weather can have a large impact on salesCatalystsCatalysts for the company include:Increased sell-side coverage - on the latest quarterly call, there were only three sell-side analysts (and two buy-side analysts) on the call. Increased coverage could increase demand for the stockFurther margin expansion to the 6-8% target rangeStore expansion - the company will open 15 new stores this yearStrong results at new store conceptsStrong results from remodelsIncreased sales from a continued west coast reboundIncreased sales from the company's entry into e-commerceConclusionAfter a recent, overblown sell-off, investors have been given the opportunity to buy BGFV at a steep discount to its competition. The margin-expansion story has already begun, and will be further supported by new store concepts, higher margin projects, and a rebound in California. The company is isolated from major competition by its focus on the west coast, and should see revenue growth as it launches an e-commerce platform. I believe there is a minimum 40% upside in the name from its current price, and am encouraging investors to buy the stock with an intermediate-term target of $24, and a longer-term target of $30.</br>Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The objectives were to describe rural livelihoods, examine how conditions for farmers have changed over time, and assess the impact of agricultural reforms on rural households. The training of enumerators, field testing of the survey and final revision of the questionnaire took place in June-July 1998. The survey itself was carried out over the period August to November 1998. The households were selected using a two-stage stratified random sample procedure based on the 1997 Pre-Census of Agriculture. In each of the six departments, villages randomly selected, with the number of villages proportional to the volume of agricultural production, subject to a minimum of 10 villages per department. In total, 100 villages were selected. In each village, nine households were randomly selected using listed prepared for the pre-Census. Three alternative households were selected for each village in case one or more of the nine were unavailable. In a few villages, the number of interviewed households was eight or ten, resulting in a final sample size of 899 farm households. \r\n\r\nTopics addressed in the survey include household and land characteristics, crop production, main agricultural activities, use of fertilizers and other inputs, source of credit, sale and use of crops, storage, consumption, time allocation, and sources of income as well as community level data on transport structure, marketing of agricultural products, village groups, agricultural production, extension services, and formal/informal credit. \r\n\r\nThe survey was conducted in collaboration with Laboratoire d'Analyse R\u00e9gionale et d'Expertise Sociale, Cotonou, Republic of Benin (LARES). Funding for the survey was provided by Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaflitche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ).",

Dumas did not give details.Shares in Hermes were almost 3 percent higher at 255.55</br>euros by 1219 GMT, the second-biggest gainer on the broader</br>French SBF120 index.Hermes posted a 14 percent rise in first-half operating</br>profit to 584.1 million euros ($772 million), thanks to strong</br>demand for its leather and silk accessories, giving the group a</br>margin of 33.1 percent.According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, Hermes was expected to</br>post a profit of 570 million euros.Hermes also confirmed on Friday its 2013 recurring operating</br>margin could be close<span style=\"\"><a href=\"http://translate.google.com.hk/?hl=zh-TW&tab=wT\">\ufffd]\ufffdg</a></span><span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000882.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/principessa-glamour-reigns-gucci-spring-142509088.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> to the 2012 record of 32.1 percent.CALF LEATHERThe company said it achieved the increase in sales and</br>profits through higher volumes after it decided not to hike</br>prices at the start of this year.\"This is a very decent set of results, the guidance is quite</br>encouraging,\" a Paris-based trader said. \"We should not</br>massively revise our numbers, but slightly tune up, to</br>completely reflect the guidance.\"Last month, Hermes reported a forecast-beating 16 percent</br>rise in second-quarter sales at constant exchange rates thanks</br>to strong demand for its leather and silk accessories, marking</br>an improvement from a 12.8 percent rise in the first quarter.At that time, it said it was getting closer to reaching last</br>year's record operating margin level, having previously</br>predicted a fall.It also forecast that full-year sales growth would slightly</br>exceed its mid-term growth target of 10 percent and recurring</br>operating income would increase slightly faster than revenue.Hermes reiterated the sales forecast on Friday, adding that</br>net cash stood at 596 million euros at the end of June.Last month, industry leader LVMH and Kering published strong</br>growth figures, but pointed to weakness in China.Hermes is faced with a dwindling supply of calf leather -</br>its No.1 raw material - because supply is driven by meat traders</br>who are responding to a drop in consumer demand for veal and</br>thus rearing and slaughtering fewer animals.Meanwhile, demand for luxury leather goods is still growing</br>and forcing the price of quality hides up 20-30 percent a</br>year. </br>($1 = 0.7562 euros)</br> (Reporting by Gilles Guillaume, James Regan and Astrid</br>Wendlandt; Additional reporting by Blaise Robinson; Editing by</br>Pravin Char)</div>\r\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.airmax87chaussures.com\">http://www.airmax87chaussures.com</a><br /><a href=\"http://roxannemyl7cg11.mywapblog.com/jimmie-johnson-dad-for-2ndtime.xhtml\">http://roxannemyl7cg11.mywapblog.com/jimmie-johnson-dad-for-2ndtime.xhtml</a>",

Dumas did not give details.Shares in Hermes were almost 3 percent higher at 255.55</br>euros by 1219 GMT, the second-biggest gainer on the broader</br>French SBF120 index.Hermes posted a 14 percent rise in first-half operating</br>profit to 584.1 million euros ($772 million), thanks to strong</br>demand for its leather and silk accessories, giving the group a</br>margin of 33.1 percent.According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, Hermes was expected to</br>post a profit of 570 million euros.Hermes also confirmed on Friday its 2013 recurring operating</br>margin could be close<span style=\"\"><a href=\"http://translate.google.com.hk/?hl=zh-TW&tab=wT\">\ufffd]\ufffdg</a></span><span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000882.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/principessa-glamour-reigns-gucci-spring-142509088.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> to the 2012 record of 32.1 percent.CALF LEATHERThe company said it achieved the increase in sales and</br>profits through higher volumes after it decided not to hike</br>prices at the start of this year.\"This is a very decent set of results, the guidance is quite</br>encouraging,\" a Paris-based trader said. \"We should not</br>massively revise our numbers, but slightly tune up, to</br>completely reflect the guidance.\"Last month, Hermes reported a forecast-beating 16 percent</br>rise in second-quarter sales at constant exchange rates thanks</br>to strong demand for its leather and silk accessories, marking</br>an improvement from a 12.8 percent rise in the first quarter.At that time, it said it was getting closer to reaching last</br>year's record operating margin level, having previously</br>predicted a fall.It also forecast that full-year sales growth would slightly</br>exceed its mid-term growth target of 10 percent and recurring</br>operating income would increase slightly faster than revenue.Hermes reiterated the sales forecast on Friday, adding that</br>net cash stood at 596 million euros at the end of June.Last month, industry leader LVMH and Kering published strong</br>growth figures, but pointed to weakness in China.Hermes is faced with a dwindling supply of calf leather -</br>its No.1 raw material - because supply is driven by meat traders</br>who are responding to a drop in consumer demand for veal and</br>thus rearing and slaughtering fewer animals.Meanwhile, demand for luxury leather goods is still growing</br>and forcing the price of quality hides up 20-30 percent a</br>year. </br>($1 = 0.7562 euros)</br> (Reporting by Gilles Guillaume, James Regan and Astrid</br>Wendlandt; Additional reporting by Blaise Robinson; Editing by</br>Pravin Char)</div>\r\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.airmax87chaussures.com\">http://www.airmax87chaussures.com</a><br /><a href=\"http://roxannemyl7cg11.mywapblog.com/jimmie-johnson-dad-for-2ndtime.xhtml\">http://roxannemyl7cg11.mywapblog.com/jimmie-johnson-dad-for-2ndtime.xhtml</a>",

at least before the foundation's announcement</br>- not all investors believe a higher offer would be justified.Foundations such as KPN's have been used to try and gain an</br>advantage in high-profile corporate battles, including luxury</br>goods maker LVMH's failed hostile takeover of Gucci in</br>1999 and hedge funds' efforts to replace the board and break up</br>chip equipment maker ASM International in 2008.Shares of America Movil, initially rose on the foundation's</br>announcement, reflecting the unpopularity of the KPN investment.</br>The purchase<span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000919.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/sonam-kapoor-gucci-stardust-cover-065226849.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> has so far resulted in billions of pesos in paper</br>losses for America Movil, Slim's flagship company.TELEFONICA FIGHTA number of analysts believe America Movil offered to buy</br>the rest of KPN to squeeze more money from Slim's great rival in</br>Latin America, Spanish company Telefonica, which is</br>seeking to acquire KPN's German unit, E-Plus.If so, the move paid off: earlier this week, Telefonica</br>raised its offer by 6 percent to 8.55 billion euros, and it won</br>America Movil's support<span style=\"\"><a href=\"HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM.HK/https://www.google.com/calendar?tab=wc\">Blogger</a></span> for the deal.The E-Plus sale will provide cash that will improve KPN's</br>balance sheet, and although it leaves the company without direct</br>exposure to Europe's biggest mobile market, it makes America</br>Movil's 2.40 euro a share offer less attractive, analysts said.In a research note written before the KPN foundation's</br>announcement, analysts at Sanford Bernstein said: \"We think that</br>KPN could be worth as much as 3 euros per share.\"Raising the bid would be out of character for billionaire</br>Slim, who has accumulated a business empire stretching from</br>retail and financial services to infrastructure and oil and gas</br>drilling companies by snapping up undervalued firms.Shares of Slim's company ended down 0.16 percent at 12.81</br>pesos in trading in Mexico on Thursday. KPN's shares closed down</br>0.65 percent before the foundation's announcement.\"The fear now will be that Slim will now try to exit - any</br>sign that he will throw in the towel and sell down his stake</br>will<b>air max 87 pas che  femme</b> hang over the KPN shares,\" said a person familiar with the</br>telecoms sector, speaking on condition of anonymity.To do that now would come at a hefty price for Slim, who is</br>still a good way<span style=\"\"><a href=\"HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM.HK//search?newwindow=1&amp;site=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Leonidas+da+Silva&amp;oi=ddle&amp;ct=leonidas_da_silvas_100th_birthday-2024005-hp&amp;hl=zh-TW\">\ufffds\ufffdi\ufffdA\ufffd\ufffd</a></span> from breaking even on his KPN investment.On average, Slim's telecoms giant paid about 3.24 euros a</br>share for its Dutch stake, including stock bought as part of a</br>rights issue by KPN earlier this year.</div>\r\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.airmax87chaussures.com\">Nike air max one pas cher online shop|air max 1 pas cher Chaussures|airmax87chaussures.com</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.nexopia.com/users/PearlT/blog/126-critical-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-used-bmw\">Nexopia | Blog</a>",

at least before the foundation's announcement</br>- not all investors believe a higher offer would be justified.Foundations such as KPN's have been used to try and gain an</br>advantage in high-profile corporate battles, including luxury</br>goods maker LVMH's failed hostile takeover of Gucci in</br>1999 and hedge funds' efforts to replace the board and break up</br>chip equipment maker ASM International in 2008.Shares of America Movil, initially rose on the foundation's</br>announcement, reflecting the unpopularity of the KPN investment.</br>The purchase<span style=\"\"><img alt=\"\\\" style='float:left;' src=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-2000-000919.jpg\"/></span><span style=\"\"><embed src=\"http://ca.screen.yahoo.com/sonam-kapoor-gucci-stardust-cover-065226849.html\" autostart=\"true\" loop=\"true\" width=\"108\" height=\"107\"></embed></span> has so far resulted in billions of pesos in paper</br>losses for America Movil, Slim's flagship company.TELEFONICA FIGHTA number of analysts believe America Movil offered to buy</br>the rest of KPN to squeeze more money from Slim's great rival in</br>Latin America, Spanish company Telefonica, which is</br>seeking to acquire KPN's German unit, E-Plus.If so, the move paid off: earlier this week, Telefonica</br>raised its offer by 6 percent to 8.55 billion euros, and it won</br>America Movil's support<span style=\"\"><a href=\"HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM.HK/https://www.google.com/calendar?tab=wc\">Blogger</a></span> for the deal.The E-Plus sale will provide cash that will improve KPN's</br>balance sheet, and although it leaves the company without direct</br>exposure to Europe's biggest mobile market, it makes America</br>Movil's 2.40 euro a share offer less attractive, analysts said.In a research note written before the KPN foundation's</br>announcement, analysts at Sanford Bernstein said: \"We think that</br>KPN could be worth as much as 3 euros per share.\"Raising the bid would be out of character for billionaire</br>Slim, who has accumulated a business empire stretching from</br>retail and financial services to infrastructure and oil and gas</br>drilling companies by snapping up undervalued firms.Shares of Slim's company ended down 0.16 percent at 12.81</br>pesos in trading in Mexico on Thursday. KPN's shares closed down</br>0.65 percent before the foundation's announcement.\"The fear now will be that Slim will now try to exit - any</br>sign that he will throw in the towel and sell down his stake</br>will<b>air max 87 pas che  femme</b> hang over the KPN shares,\" said a person familiar with the</br>telecoms sector, speaking on condition of anonymity.To do that now would come at a hefty price for Slim, who is</br>still a good way<span style=\"\"><a href=\"HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM.HK//search?newwindow=1&amp;site=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Leonidas+da+Silva&amp;oi=ddle&amp;ct=leonidas_da_silvas_100th_birthday-2024005-hp&amp;hl=zh-TW\">\ufffds\ufffdi\ufffdA\ufffd\ufffd</a></span> from breaking even on his KPN investment.On average, Slim's telecoms giant paid about 3.24 euros a</br>share for its Dutch stake, including stock bought as part of a</br>rights issue by KPN earlier this year.</div>\r\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.airmax87chaussures.com\">Nike air max one pas cher online shop|air max 1 pas cher Chaussures|airmax87chaussures.com</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.nexopia.com/users/PearlT/blog/126-critical-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-used-bmw\">Nexopia | Blog</a>",

        "notes": "The CWEEDS files are computer data sets of hourly weather conditions occurring\r\nat 145 Canadian locations for up to 48 years of record, starting as early as\r\n1953, and ending for most locations in 2001. The primary purpose of these files\r\nis to provide long term weather records for use in urban planning, siting and\r\ndesign of wind and solar renewable energy systems, and design of energy\r\nefficient buildings. The general nature of the files, however, results in their\r\nwidespread applicability to any sector which is weather-sensitive, such as\r\ntransportation, air quality, agriculture, forestry, tourism, structural design,\r\nor general interest.\r\n\r\nUsers will likely find most value in providing the files as input into other\r\nsoftware that processes the observational data in some way that provides more\r\nspecific information germane to the user's requirements. For example, the\r\ninformation in the CWEEDS files can be used as input to design software that\r\nsimulates building or solar energy system performance on an hourly basis. Other\r\npossibilities include the calculation of summary statistics regarding the wind\r\nenergy potential at a location, or finding the means, variability, extremes, or\r\nfrequency of other weather conditions or combination of conditions specifically\r\ntailored to suit an application.\r\n\r\nThere is virtually no limit to the variety of useful analyses that can be\r\nperformed with the data in the CWEEDS files. The user will, however, need to\r\nprovide the software which will perform any additional analyses. Importing the\r\ndata into a spreadsheet or data base program is a common way in which further\r\nanalysis may be performed.\r\n\r\nThe CWEEDS CD-ROMs and disk only include compressed, formatted files of\r\nobserved and estimated weather observations, utility software to uncompress and\r\ncopy the files from the CD-ROMs, and documentation to explain the development,\r\ncontent, and format of the files.\r\n\r\nMost of the 21 weather elements such as temperature and wind speed have been\r\nabstracted directly from the National Digital Climate Archives maintained by\r\nthe Atmospheric Environment Service (AES) of Environment Canada in Downsview,\r\nOntario. Nine of the weather elements relate to solar irradiance amounts and\r\nhave been estimated for each hour for those elements and locations for which\r\nobservations are not available.\r\n\r\nThe computer data sets are arranged so that one year of weather data for one\r\nlocation is contained in one file about one megabyte in size in the\r\nuncompressed, WYEC2 format described below. There are 48 files, for instance,\r\ntotalling over 48 megabytes disk space in WYEC2 format for the full 1953-2001\r\nCWEEDS period of record. In total, the full CWEEDS 4500 files comprise a little\r\nover 4.5 gigabytes. \r\n\r\nA second set of files, called CWEC (Canadian Weather year for Energy\r\nCalculation), has been provided for convenience for a limited number of the\r\nlocations. These files are described in Section 4.\r\n",

        "notes": "Sentence-layer annotation represents the most coarse-grained annotation in this\r\ncorpus. We adhere to definitions of objectivity and subjectivity introduced in\r\n(Wiebe et al., 2005). Additionally, we followed guidelines drawn from (Balahur &\r\nSteinberger, 2009). Their clarifications proved to be quite effective, raising\r\ninter-annotator agreement in a sentence-layer polarity annotation task from\r\nabout 50% to >80%. All sentences were annotated in two dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe first dimension covers the factual nature of the sentence, i.e. whether it\r\nprovides objective information or if it is intended to express an opinion,\r\nbelief or subjective argument. Therefore, it is either objective or subjective.\r\nThe second dimension covers the semantic orientation of the sentence, i.e. its\r\npolarity. Thus, it is either positive, negative or neutral.\r\n\r\nIn the second layer, we model the contextually interpreted sentiments on the\r\nlevels of words and NP/PP phrases. That is, the annotation decisions\r\nare based on the meaning of the words in the context of the sentence.\r\n\r\nWord sentiment markers:\r\nThe sentiments on the level of individual words are expressed by\r\nsingle character markers added at the end of the words.\r\n\r\nA word might be positive (+), negative(-), neutral(empty), a shifter\r\n(~), an intensifier (^), or a diminisher (%).\r\n\r\nIf a word ends with a hyphen (e.g., \"auf beziehungs-_ bzw.\r\npartnerschaftliche Probleme-\", an underscore is added to the word in\r\norder to prevent missinterpretations of the hyphen as a negative\r\nmarker.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only words that are part of an NP/PP are marked with\r\nsentiment markers. Annotated words are nouns, adjectives, negation\r\nparticles, prepositions, adverbs.\r\n\r\nThe world level annotation was done by 3 persons individually. The\r\nindividual results were harmonized into a single reference annotation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhrase level markers:\r\n\r\nEach phrase is marked up textually by brackets, e.g. \"[auf\r\nbeziehungs-_ bzw. partnerschaftliche Probleme-]\". The type of a phrase\r\n(NP/PP) is not written to the brackets. We follow largely the\r\nannotation model of TIGER for structuring embedded NPs and PPs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the following limitations with regard to TIGER exist: (1)\r\nAdjectival phrases are not marked up (2) Relative or infinitival\r\nsentences are not included in NPs/PPs if they appear at the end of a\r\nphrase or if the are discontiguous. We do not only annotate the\r\nphrases which immediately contain words that are marked up as polar.\r\nAny dependent subphrase (NP/PP) is integrated into all its dominating\r\nNPs/PPs, e.g. \"[Die tieferen Ursachen [der Faszination+]]\". Dependent\r\nsubphrases without any polar words are also included, however, there\r\nis no internal bracketing for them, e.g. \"[hohe+ Anspr\u00fcche an Qualit\u00e4t\r\nund Lage]\"\r\n\r\nAt the level of phrases, we distinguish the following markers:\r\npositive (+), negative (-), neutral(0), bipolar (#). The category\r\n'bipolar' is used mainly for coordinations where negative and positive\r\nsentiments of something are kept in balance by the writer. This is\r\nquite common for a lot of binomial constructions as \"Krieg und\r\nFrieden\".",

Before trying to understand the actual figures, it's highly recommended to read the Blue Book (Libro Azul) in order to understand the budget structure.\r\n\r\nBoth the budget initially proposed by the government and the version approved by the Parliament are available, but the resource linked in this package is the latter.\r\n\r\nTwo versions of the budget are made available: first, the information is released as a set of PDF-only \"books\" (expenses, income, personnel...); additionally, the same information is broken down into its smallest components, with one file per department and expense programme. In this latter case, an HTML version of the files is also made available, which is much more convenient for automated processing.\r\n\r\nThe budget files can either be accessed online or downloaded in a single ZIP file. \r\n\r\nA spreadsheet containing expenses aggregated by function is included. Some work has been done to manually map the Spanish categories into Cofog, but only for Level 1. This is very much work in progress and not reviewed. ",

The deaths in this age group are mainly due to so-called endogenous causes, e.g., related to conditions of pregnancy and birth defects or malformations of the child. The external factors contributing to infant mortality in the post-neonatal period and are generally a result of diseases related to poor sanitation, inadequate medical services and difficult access, inadequate nutrition, injury and poisoning.\r\n\r\n# Satisfaction with Health, Data source: I.Stat\r\nThe percentage of people over the age of 14, who are either \"very much satisfied\" or \"quite satisfied\" with their health. This is a part of the \"Multipurpose Survey on Households: Aspects of Daily Life\".\r\n\r\n# Chronic deseases\r\nPersons with a chronic desease per 100 people.

The labor force was divided into skilled and unskilled labor, both disaggregated by whether a person works in the tradables or nontradables sector, whether he/she works in an urban or rural area, and by gender. Institutions were comprised of households, the government, an enterprise account and the rest of the world.

Using project documents, gathered from in-country donor offices during three missions to Lilongwe, the AidData and CCAPS teams added standardized geocodes using the UCDP/AidData methodology. In total, projects from 30 donor agencies were geocoded for 548 projects, representing $5.3 billion in total commitments (approximately 80% of the total external assistance to Malawi reported to the government from 2000-2011). It represents the first effort to sub-nationally geocode all donors in a single partner country, and the first initiative of the sort envisioned by the Open Aid Partnership, an initiative spearheaded by the World Bank to increase the openness and effectiveness of development assistance at the subnational level. An interactive map displaying these data along with data on armed conflict, governance, and climate security vulnerability can be viewed at www.strausscenter.org/ccaps/mappingtool.",
